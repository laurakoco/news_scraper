It includes the belief that Trump is secretly saving the world from a satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals and has been linked to some violent crimes across the country.  More:RNC speaker pulled from lineup after boosting QAnon-tied conspiracy about Jewish people More:Trump says QAnon conspiracy theorists 'like me very much' and 'love our country' QAnon also caused controversy during the Republican National Convention.  Tuesday, Mary Ann Mendoza, an RNC speaker, was removed from the night's lineup after earlier retweeting anti-Semitic posts tied to the conspiracy theory. After her removal, she apologized in a later post for \"not paying attention to the intent of the whole message.\"  Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia congressional candidate tied to the theory, tweeted Tuesday that she would be attending Trump's RNC speech in person Thursday.  \"I’m honored and thrilled to be invited to attend President Trump’s acceptance speech Thursday evening at the White House,\" she tweeted Tuesday. \"I’m also equally excited to vote for him again November 3rd, and I’m working hard all over Georgia to help him win.\" Despite criticism, several QAnon-linked candidates have won Republican primaries this year. Progressive watchdog group Media Matters for America counts at least 19 Republican congressional candidates linked to QAnon, and several are likely to be elected to Congress in the November elections.  Greene is likely to win the general election in her deep-red district in northwestern Georgia. Trump called her a \"future Republican Star\" in a tweet after her primary win, though White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Trump had not \"done a deep dive into the statements\" of Greene. Another QAnon-linked candidate, Lauren Boebert, beat incumbent Rep. Scott Tipton for the Republican primary in Colorado's 3rd Congressional District earlier this year. Boebert is also favored to win the general election in the district.  Both Greene and Boebert have tried to distance themselves from their previous connections to the conspiracy theories.  Greene told Fox News QAnon \"doesn't represent me\" and that she was just \"looking at other information\" online,\" and Boebert told local TV station Fox 31 Denver she was \"not a follower.\"  \"QAnon is a lot of things to different people,\" Boebert said. \"I was very vague in what I said before. I’m not into conspiracies. I’m into freedom and the Constitution of the United States of America. I’m not a follower.\"  More:Lawmakers introduce bipartisan measure condemning right-wing conspiracy theory QAnon Trump said at a press briefing on Aug. 19 that he did not know much about QAnon other than that \"they like me very much, which I appreciate.\"  \"These are people that don't like seeing what's going on in places like Portland, Chicago and New York and other cities and states,\" he told reporters. \"I've heard these are people that love our country.\" When a reporter further explained the theory to Trump, including the belief that Trump is secretly saving the world from a satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals, Trump responded: \"Is that supposed to be a bad thing? If I can help save the world from problems I'm willing to do it, I'm willing to put myself out there.\"  McEnany said earlier on Aug. 19 she had \"never heard of that (support for QAnon) from the president.\" Media Matters for America says Trump has retweeted Q-linked accounts at least 216 times.  Political leaders on both sides of the aisle have condemned the conspiracy theory.  Vice President Mike Pence said on CNN's \"New Day\" last Friday QAnon was a \"conspiracy theory\" to be dismissed \"out of hand.\"  And House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Fox News last week, \"There is no place for QAnon in the Republican Party.\"  Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., and Rep. Denver Riggelman, R-Va., introduced legislation Tuesday that would condemn the theories. “It’s time for us to come together across party lines to say that QAnon has no place in our nation’s political discourse,” Malinowski said.  The measure would condemn QAnon; ask federal law enforcement agencies to remain vigilant against violence provoked by conspiracy theories; and urge Americans to get information from trustworthy sources. The measure must first pass the House Judiciary Committee before it can be considered by the full House of Representatives.  Facebook took action last week to ban hundreds of groups linked to QAnon, though it did not outright ban QAnon content from the site, and Twitter has banned thousands of accounts linked to QAnon.  Contributing: Courtney Subramanian, Savannah Behrmann  More:Facebook bans more than 790 groups tied to QAnon, plus more than 980 militia-linked groups"}, {"id": "usatoday1", "publisher": "usatoday", "label": "left-center", "title": "Four years ago, Stefanik, who ranks as one of the most bi-partisan in Congress, kept her distance from Trump, saying vaguely she endorsed the \"party's nominee.\" Now she's emerged as one of Trump's most fervent supporters and snatched a prime speaking spot for this year's RNC.", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/08/26/rnc-elise-stefanik-considered-rising-star-staunch-ally-trump/5637673002/", "section": "news", "date": "2020-08-26-09PM", "body": "WASHINGTON – Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who was previously the youngest woman elected to Congress, appeared at the Republican National Convention Wednesday evening to stump for President Donald Trump. Stefanik, who ranks as one of the most bipartisan members of in Congress, kept her distance from then-candidate Donald Trump four years ago, saying vaguely she endorsed the Republican \"party's nominee\" without mentioning Trump's name. Kellyanne Conway to speak at RNC ahead of White House departure: What to know about her She also didn't attend the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Now, Stefanik, 36, who has emerged as one of the president's most fervent supporters on Capitol Hill, snatched a prime speaking-slot for this year's RNC. She railed against Democrats in her support for Trump, saying the \"American people were not swayed by these partisan attacks. Our support for President Trump is stronger than ever before.\"  \"We understand that this election is a choice between the far-left Democratic Socialist agenda versus protecting and preserving the American Dream,\" she continued. \"Now we face a critical choice: Joe Biden's far-left failed policies of the past 47 years, or President Trump who will stand up for the American people and the Constitution,\" Stefanik said. \"I believe in the wisdom and spirit of the American people to elect the only candidate who is capable of protecting the American Dream, President Donald J. Trump.\" Stefanik, who is co-leading Trump's reelection campaign in New York, was elected in 2014. Prior, she attended Harvard University before joining the Bush White House as an aide. In 2012, she advised then-vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, and prepped him for his debate against then-Vice President Joe Biden before deciding to run to join the former Speaker of the House in Congress. Trump has called Stefanik a “new Republican star” as she defended him against Democrats. Stefanik was named one of the members of Trump's Impeachment Defense Team of House members during the Senate after her viral role in the House's proceedings. Their unofficial role was to do media appearances and work on messaging behind the scenes to demean the House manager's case against the president to the public. She mentioned the impeachment trial Wednesday, saying \"Trump has fought tirelessly to deliver results for all Americans, despite the Democrats' baseless and illegal impeachment sham and the media's endless obsession with it.\" \"I was proud to lead the effort standing up for the Constitution, President Trump, and most importantly the American people. This attack was not just on the President, it was an attack on you - your voice and your vote,\" she said. The Senate acquitted Trump for his dealings with Ukraine in February, but House Democrats impeached him last December on two charges — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Policy-wise, Stefanik is more moderate than some of her GOP House colleagues. She opposed the president's 2017 tax cut and has supported giving legal status to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.

Here's what we know Ahead of her convention appearance, her Democratic challenger, Tedra Cobb, attacked Stefanik as “shilling” for the president, saying she was more intent on expanding her national profile than representing the district.  Stefanik represents the 21st District of New York, which voted for President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 before pivoting to Trump in 2016.

Some of Bondi's remarks to the Republican National Convention were accurate, others were misleading.  Bondi attacked the Bidens for their work in Ukraine when Vice President Biden led the U.S. government's anti-corruption campaign in Ukraine, and Hunter Biden secured a lucrative post on the board of a gas company there. \"We all know about Joe’s son, Hunter Biden,\" Bondi said Tuesday. \"A corrupt Ukrainian oligarch put Hunter on the board of his gas company, even though he had no experience in Ukraine or in the energy sector. None. Yet he was paid millions to do nothing.\" Hunter Biden was on the board from 2014 to 2019 of Burisma Holdings, Ukraine's largest gas company for which he was paid as much$50,000 per month, according to the New York Times. Bondi's statement that Hunter Biden lacked experience in the energy sector is accurate. However, there is no evidence that Hunter Biden was involved in wrongdoing. Nor is it unusual for Ukrainian companies to burnish their credentials by placing prominent people on their boards, according to a former U.S. diplomat. For example, Cofer Black, who served as George W. Bush's CIA counterterrorism chief, joined Burisma's board in 2017.  Joe Biden has acknowledged that his son's work in Ukraine had created the appearance of a conflict of interest and that his son regretted taking the seat on the board.  \"He said he regretted having done it,\" Biden said on NBC earlier this year. \"Speaks for himself. He's a grown man.\" Hunter Biden acknowledged in an interview with ABC that he likely would not have been offered the job had his father not been vice president. However, he said he served the company honorably and had done nothing improper. Bondi also re-aired a false claim that Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who had investigated Burisma. \"Recently reported information revealed that a few months after Hunter Biden joined that corrupt company’s board, the Obama-Biden State Department began doing business with them, even when it remained under investigation for corruption,\" Bondi said. \"And it gets worse: that very same company was being investigated by a Ukrainian prosecutor. Joe Biden, the vice president of the United States, threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine unless that same prosecutor was fired, and then he was fired.\" Bondi toes the line here, suggesting the reason Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor was to protect his son. That assertion has been debunked. Biden forced out the prosecutor for the opposite reason. Not because Viktor Shokin had been investigating Burisma but Shokin hadn't pursued corruption among the country's politicians. Shokin's inaction prompted international calls for his ouster and ultimately resulted in his removal by Ukraine's parliament. Moreover, Shokin's office had investigated Burisma, but the probe focused on a period before Hunter Biden joined the company, according to the country's anti-corruption bureau.  Left unsaid by Bondi is President Trump's impeachment by the House of Representatives for pressuring Ukraine's president to investigate Joe Biden by withholding military aid and a White House visit. The Senate acquitted Trump. Bondi also used the convention stage to re-air claims about the younger Biden’s business interests in China, suggesting that the Chinese sought to curry favor with the Obama administration. The former Florida attorney general said Biden, while vice president, traveled to China with “Hunter along for the ride.” “In Beijing, Hunter didn’t just go sightseeing. He had meetings with his Chinese bank partners,” Bondi said. “Hunter even arranged for his dad to meet with one of the partners. Ten days later, those Chinese communist bankers approved millions to go to Hunter’s firm and those bankers work for the Chinese Communist Party, which oppresses their people, cheated American workers for decades and covered up a deadly virus. To this day, Hunter controls a 10% stake in that firm.” It is true that Hunter Biden traveled to Beijing with his father in 2013.  While in the Chinese capital, according to an account in the New Yorker, Hunter Biden arranged for his father to meet China-based business associate Jonathan Li, linked to the investment firm, BHR, where the younger Biden served as a board member. “Afterward, Hunter and Li had what both parties described as a social meeting,” the New Yorker reported. “How do I go to Beijing, halfway around the world, and not see them for a cup of coffee?” he said. Hunter Biden’s attorney George Mesires  said that his client, who resigned his post last year, had not received any compensation for being on the BHR board, nor did he receive any equity in it while Joe Biden was vice president.  The former vice president’s son also has pledged not serve on boards of foreign companies if his father is elected president."}, {"id": "usatoday3", "publisher": "usatoday", "label": "left-center", "title": "The third night of the convention spotlighted a host of women who support or work for President Donald Trump.", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/26/rnc-live-mike-pence-speech-trump-during-convention/5636612002/", "section": "news", "date": "2020-08-26-09PM", "body": "Refresh often for updates throughout Day 2 of the RNC. It’s a claim that President Donald Trump and his allies have been increasingly pushing this campaign: Democrat Joe Biden, they assert, has embraced a “far-left” agenda on policing.   “Joe Biden has turned his candidacy over to the far-left, anti-law enforcement,” said Michael McHale with the National Association of Police Organizations, which has supported Trump’s candidacy. But the facts don’t match that claim. While it’s true that some on the left have called for defunding police departments, Biden has repeatedly distanced himself from that position. \"As his criminal justice proposal made clear months ago, Vice President Biden does not believe that police should be defunded,\" campaign spokesman Andrew Bates told USA TODAY in June. Pressed on the point in an interview with Fox News last month, Trump pointed to a “unity” platform released by Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders. That platform calls for banning chokeholds and ending racial profiling, but does not recommend defunding police departments. Biden has also called for a $300 million increase in police funding to address concerns about racial profiling. — John Fritze Rep. Elise Stefanik recited the heroic history of her congressional district in upstate New York, from the Battle of Saratoga that turned the tide in the Revolutionary War to the Olympic hockey team that won the gold medal against the Soviet Union in Lake Placid 40 years ago in the “miracle on ice.” “Since our nation's founding, generation after generation of everyday Americans served and sacrificed to preserve and strengthen the American Dream,” said Stefanik, who was the first member of her immediate family to graduate from college and the youngest Republican woman ever elected to Congress. “The vision of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness – and the idea that if you work hard and dream big, you can achieve anything you imagine.” Stefanik, who gained the national spotlight as a vocal defender of President Donald Trump during the \"endless impeachment sham,\" praised him for working to reopen the Main Street economy from the coronavirus lockdown. She contrasted him with his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, who has proposed to raise taxes as part of his economic recovery plans. “I believe in the wisdom and spirit of the American people to elect the only candidate who is capable of protecting the American dream, President Donald J. Trump,” Stefanik said. — Bart Jansen The head of an organization representing more than 240,000 police officers across the country took aim at the leaders of large city mayors, saying they had abandoned rank-and-file law officers in the wake of civil unrest and calls for racial justice. “Good officers need to know that their elected leaders and the department brass have their backs,” said Michael McHale, president of the National Association of Police Organizations. “Unfortunately, chaos results when failed officials in cities like Portland, Minneapolis, Chicago, and New York make the conscious decision not to support law enforcement,\" he said. \"Shootings, murders, looting and rioting occur unabated.” The organization has endorsed Trump for re-election after having supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden in 2008 and 2012. McHale called Biden and Harris \"the most radical anti-police ticket in history.\" Trump and his surrogates have often accused Biden of supporting the “de-funding” of police agencies, a position the former vice president has repeatedly rejected. But the mostly-peaceful protests and civil unrest triggered by the calls for racial justice in the wake of George Floyd’s May 25 death and other victims of police brutality have seen public support for police plummet. McHale, a former Sarasota, Florida, police officer, echoed Trump’s “law-and-order” rhetoric that Democratic-led cities have sat idly by while their downtowns burn. But mayors have said the president has helped foment the civil unrest with his charged rhetoric and deployment of federal troops to cities like Portland that have heightened tensions. — Ledyard King White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told a compelling and deeply personal story about her decision to undergo a preventative double mastectomy after testing positive for the BRCA2 gene that increased her risk for cancer. The story was moving, and it portrayed Trump as a compassionate boss who checked in with McEnany at perhaps the most traumatic time in her life. “I was blown away,” McEnany said, recalling a phone call she received from the president. “Here was the leader of the free world, caring about my circumstance.” But McEnany veered into a far more disputed territory when she claimed that the president’s actions indicated he “stands by Americans with pre-existing conditions.” Trump largely ran in 2016 on rolling back the 2016 health care law that ensured Americans with pre-existing conditions could purchase health coverage. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has declined to defend a lawsuit brought by Republican states that would unwind those protections. Trump has repeatedly said he will unveil a new health care law to take care of people with pre-existing conditions, but so far has not done so. — John Fritze The Republican Party brought in a former football coach at a major Catholic school to attack Joe Biden over the abortion issue – and even his commitment to Catholicism. \"The Biden-(Kamala) Harris ticket is the most radically pro-abortion campaign in history,\" ex-Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz said, adding that Biden and similar politicians \"are 'Catholics in Name Only' and abandon innocent lives.\" The Trump supporter also said that \"nobody has been a stronger advocate for the unborn\" than the president. Biden says he is a devout Catholic who has respectful disagreements with the church on issues like abortion. Best known for his work at Notre Dame – his 1988 team won a national championship – Holtz also coached at William & Mary, North Carolina State, Arkansas, Minnesota, and South Carolina. He has also been a noted television commentator – on football, not politics. – David Jackson The third night of the convention spotlighted a host of women who support or work for President Donald Trump to shore up his eroding support among female voters, a group political analysts say are key to the president’s re-election. Wednesday’s program heavily relied on female voices as well as highlighted the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment through a slickly produced video and speeches from White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, Second Lady Karen Pence and White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway.  McEnany took the stage to offer a softer side of Trump, whom she said called her after she underwent a preventative mastectomy after testing positive for the BRCA2 gene mutation. Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway talked about how Trump empowered her to lead his successful 2016 bid while promoting women to senior positions in business and government. “He confides in and consults us, respects our opinions, and insists that we are on equal footing with the men,” she said. White, suburban women – once-reliable Republican voters – overwhelmingly rejected the GOP and helped the Democrats retake the House of Representatives in 2018, raising alarm that a similar gender gap could play out in November. Disapproval of Trump’s handling of the pandemic among women has only underscored his growing deficit ahead of the election. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found Trump behind Biden by 16 points among registered female voters. — Courtney Subramanian In what is likely to be her final public address in her current position, senior White House counselor Kellyanne Conway praised the president because she said he has “elevated” women to leadership roles in his administration and is a “champion” for Americans who are “everyday heroes.” Conway, who recently announced she will be leaving her job in the Trump administration at the end of this month, highlighted those she said are championed by the president, including teachers and health care workers who have worked through the coronavirus pandemic. “A woman in a leadership role still can seem novel,” Conway said. “Not so for President Trump.” “President Trump helped me shatter a barrier in the world of politics by empowering me to manage his campaign to its successful conclusion,” she said.  Conway was the first woman to lead a presidential campaign to victory in 2016, when she was Trump’s campaign manager in the final few months of the race.  Conway and her husband, conservative lawyer and Trump critic George Conway, are both stepping back from their jobs to focus on their family, they said. Their home life has been the subject of attention because of George Conway’s attacks on his wife’s boss and the recent social media presence of their teenage daughter, who has described an increasingly turbulent situation at home. — Jeanine Santucci White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany gave a more personal speech in her convention appearance Wednesday, praising President Donald Trump's support as she had a baby shortly after a mastectomy. \"I want my daughter to grow up in President Donald J. Trump’s America,\" McEnany said. A former campaign spokeswoman who became White House press secretary this year, McEnany has spoken openly about the genetic mutation that made her vulnerable to breast cancer. She opted to have a preventative mastectomy on May 1, 2018. McEnany, who has spoken at political rallies and urged women to support Trump, now has a daughter who is nine years old. Choosing a preventative mastectomy was \"the hardest decision\" she has ever made, McEnany said, but supporting Trump \"was the easiest.\" - David Jackson  Tera Myers spoke about her son Samuel, who has Down syndrome and advocated for “education freedom,” or school choice, a popular issue with President Donald Trump’s supporters. “I would like to extend my thanks to President Trump and his administration for their work towards making every student’s dream of a meaningful education a reality,” Myers said. She also lauded Trump for his anti-abortion stance, saying she was advised to terminate her pregnancy due to her son's disability. Trump has made it a point to call for broader school choice, which includes nontraditional schools that get public money, such as charter schools and private or religious schools that may receive taxpayer money as an alternative to public schools attended based on location. School choice critics argue that it takes needed funding away from public schools. Myers said that “one size did not fit all” with education, and that she helped pass legislation in Ohio that provides a scholarship to students with disabilities to attend a chosen school system. Myers quoted her son: “School choice helped my dreams come true. My school taught me the way I learn best. I was able to fit in. I made many friends. I became a part of my community. My teachers helped me become the best I can be.” Rebecca Cokley, director of the Center for American Progress' Disability Justice Initiative, said in a statement that school choice is a “fallacy” for students with disabilities because private schools that accept vouchers aren’t required to comply with certain federal laws designed to give equal access to education for disabled students. “It takes advantage of parents that want the best for their kids as all parents do, and sells away their civil rights instead,” she said. — Jeanine Santucci Voters watching the RNC are being bombarded with multiple messages at the same time: Pitches for President Donald Trump, arguments against Democrat Joe Biden, a sense of building excitement and, more subtly, a sense of place. Those places tend to be battlegrounds. Many of the non-politician speakers during the RNC on Wednesday hail from competitive states. The lineup Wednesday night included: Clarence Henderson, a civil rights leader, from North Carolina; Tera Myers, a school choice advocate from Ohio; and Scott Dane, who represents a logging and trucking association in Minnesota. \"America needs us to keep building and we can’t wait to be part of it,\" Dane said. \"In 47 years in Washington, Joe Biden hasn’t done anything for the timber industry.\" Sometimes the speakers don’t mention their home states on stage, and they don’t have to: Voters find out through an inevitable barrage of media coverage about the hometown business person sharing the “virtual” stage with a president.  — John Fritze Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw earned two Bronze Stars and lost an eye fighting as a SEAL in Afghanistan. But he said America’s heroes aren’t just the ones on the battlefield. “It’s the nurse who volunteers for back to back shifts caring for COVID patients because she feels that’s her duty,” the freshman GOP congressman said during the third night of the Republican National Convention. \"It’s the parent who will re-learn algebra because there’s no way they’re letting their kid fall behind while schools are closed. And It’s the cop that gets spit on one day and will save a child’s life the next.” Crenshaw’s message was notably upbeat during a convention that has often portrayed Democrats as dangerous, immoral and promoters of chaos. In fact, Crenshaw never mentioned the Democrats and only once mentioned the president though not by name. Instead, he focused on the everyday Americans who have tried to keep people healthy in a pandemic and safe during mostly peaceful protests that have at times ben wracked by looting and riots. “Here’s the truth about America: we are a country of heroes. I believe that, so should you,” Crenshaw said. “We are a people with a common set of ideals conceived in liberty.” — Ledyard King Sen. Marsha Blackburn lauded the country’s heroes among first responders and in the military, but she blasted Democrats for supporting nationwide protests against police. “Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and their radical allies try to destroy these heroes, because if there are no heroes to inspire us—government can control us,” Blackburn, R-Tenn., said from the Mellon Auditorium in Washington. “Leftists try to turn them into villains. They try to ‘cancel’ them. But I’m here to tell you that these heroes can’t be cancelled.” Blackburn, who represents the “volunteer state,” also criticized social distancing restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 that have closed stores and prevented churches from meeting in person. “They say we can’t gather in groups at church, but encourage protests, riots, and looting in the streets,” Blackburn said. “If the Democrats had their way, they would keep you locked in your house until you become dependent on the government for everything.” — Bart Jansen The Republican convention kicked off its third night with an attack on violence in “Democrat-run cities” as the nation is wrestling with a deadly shooting in Wisconsin. “From Seattle and Portland to Washington and New York, Democrat-run cities across this country are being overrun by violent mobs. The violence is rampant,” South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said in the first major remarks of the evening. “There’s looting, chaos, destruction, and murder. People that can afford to flee have fled. But the people that can’t - good, hard-working Americans - are left to fend for themselves.” For three nights, violent protests have torn through Kenosha after a police officer shot Jacob Blake from behind at close range while he was getting in a vehicle. Buildings have been burned, windows smashed out and stores looted. A 17-year-old suspected of fatally shooting two people and wounding a third in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was arrested as protests over police brutality and the shooting of Blake continue to rock the city and the country. Court records show Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, faces a first-degree intentional homicide charge in Kenosha County. — John Fritze and N'dea Yancey-Bragg A speaker who had been expected to deliver remarks on the third night of the Republican National Convention has been unexpectedly removed from the program hours before airtime. Another speaker's appearance is up in the air. The campaign confirmed that Robert Unanue, the president and CEO of Goya Foods, will not be speaking Wednesday night, citing a “logistical problem.” Unanue’s praise of President Donald Trump at the White House last month sparked a boycott of his company’s products. Also unclear is the status of a speech by former professional football player Jack Brewer. Brewer was charged with insider trading by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month. The campaign would not say definitively whether he will speak. Organizers on Tuesday pulled another featured speaker, “Angel Mom” Mary Ann Mendoza, after she directed her Twitter followers to a series of anti-Semitic, conspiratorial messages hours before her prerecorded segment was set to air. — Associated Press Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for vice president, told a virtual fundraiser Wednesday that Joe Biden’s administration would offer unwavering support for Israel and would never let Iran obtain a nuclear weapon. “Joe has made it clear he will not tie security assistance to any political decisions that Israel makes and I couldn't agree more,” Harris said. \"I pledge to you the Biden-Harris administration will sustain our unbreakable commitment to Israel's security including the unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation pioneered during the Obama-Biden administration and the guarantee that Israel will always maintain its qualitative military edge.\" Biden as vice president was a key advocate for Israel’s security, with support for technologies such as Iron Dome and a memo for $38 billion over a decade in defense assistance signed in 2016, which Harris called “the largest military aid package in U.S. history.” Harris was also asked, in the aftermath of President Donald Trump withdrawing from a contentious nuclear agreement with Iran, how the Biden administration would protect Israel from Iran. \"Let me be clear, we will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. Period,” Harris said. “We will continue to ensure that Israel has the unbreakable support of the United States.” The Obama administration’s nuclear deal sought to hinder Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon. But the deal was heavily criticized, with skeptics saying it was unenforceable, and Trump withdrew from it. Harris said Iran “is revving up its nuclear activity and becoming more provocative.” \"I serve on the Intelligence committee and I believe that we are more isolated than ever from our allies and that we need help for us to meet this challenge,” Harris said. “The Trump administration took the issue of arms embargo against Iran to the security council recently and only one other country voted with us. I think it's fair to say this America First approach has been America alone which is not in our best interest or in the interest of our allies.” — Bart Jansen President Donald Trump on Wednesday floated the idea that he and Democrat Joe Biden should take a drug test before their first debate – reprising an unfounded line of attack he also used against Hillary Clinton in 2016. \"We're going to call for a drug test, by the way, because his best performance was against Bernie,\" Trump told The Washington Examiner in an interview Wednesday. Trump offered zero evidence to support the theory that Biden used drugs to improve his debate performance. Trump used the same baseless attack against Clinton in 2016, telling a crowd then that, “I think we should take a drug test prior to the debate.” Democrats dismissed the attack.  \"Biden should agree to take a drug test if Trump will agree to be strapped to a lie detector,\" tweeted Tommy Vietor, a former spokesman in the Obama administration.  – John Fritze Democrats have been running a counter program throughout the Republican convention. They had plenty to complain about from the GOP's second night. Among the issues: The president's decision to conduct a series of official acts in the White House and broadcast those events during a political convention. Also drawing fire: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's speech from Israel.  \"These people are so unethical, whether it is legal, illegal. We think that it is illegal,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters on Wednesday.  More:'The rules go out the window': Democrats deride RNC over Hatch Act Is it illegal? Trump has noted he is exempt from the Hatch Act, the law that prohibits the use of taxpayer resources for campaigning. It's another matter for aides, but White House officials have been dinged for violations before – with little to no consequence. Even Democrats seemed resigned to move on.   \"The American people know these people are unethical and illegal and doing things outside the law,” Pelosi said. “What they want to know is what we’re going to be doing for them.\" – John Fritze and Bart Jansen   Vice President Mike Pence will have the spotlight at the RNC, though he may spend much of his speech praising the real star of show: President Donald Trump. If his past speeches on the campaign trail are any indication, Pence's remarks are likely to lavish praise for Trump while offering harsh denunciations of Democrat Joe Biden and what the Trump team has labeled \"socialist\" policies of Democrats. Pence will go on the road for the speech, heading to Baltimore's Fort McHenry.  Other big draws for the night: Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president who recently announced she's leaving the White House, and Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law. – David Jackson and John Fritze"}, {"id": "usatoday4", "publisher": "usatoday", "label": "left-center", "title": "Second lady Karen Pence is a military mom, art teacher and pet lover who has taken an increased role in the Trump/Pence re-election campaign.", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/26/rnc-what-know-karen-pence/5638005002/", "section": "news", "date": "2020-08-26-09PM", "body": "Karen Pence, who has focused much of her initiatives as second lady on military families, used her spotlight at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday to praise them as heroes. She spotlighted two military spouses who created R. Riveter, a handbag company named after the Rosie the Riveter campaign used to recruit women workers during World War II. Another “military spouse hero,” Jilan Hall-Johnson of Montana, worked with the Small Business Administration’s Development Center to start a restaurant, the Sassy Biscuit. “These men and women, like our daughter, Charlotte, and our daughter-in-law, Sarah, are the home front heroes,” she said of military spouses. Here's what you should know about Karen Pence: The Pences’ son, Michael, is a pilot in the Marine Corps. Their oldest daughter, Charlotte, is married to a Navy pilot. Karen Pence’s efforts to support military families has included pushing states to make it easier for military spouses to transfer professional credentials. She’s also a lead ambassador for a suicide-prevention initiative initially created by the administration to help veterans but also being used to reach out to all Americans struggling with the coronavirus pandemic. Pence has also used her position to bring attention to the art therapy profession. When she was Indiana's first lady, Pence played an instrumental role in the development of the art therapy program at the Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. But at the annual American Art Therapy Association meeting in 2017, some art therapists questioned whether Pence should be allowed to promote their profession, arguing that some policies of the administration don't mesh with art therapy’s code of ethics. More:Here's why some art therapists are in a heated debate over Karen Pence A watercolor artist, Pence teaches art part-time at a Christian school in Northern Virginia. In a Fox News interview before her convention speech Wednesday, Pence emphasized that her school is “100% kids at school.” The Trump administration has urged schools not to teach students remotely despite the pandemic.  “We have ways that we can take precautions,” she said of the novel coronavirus. Pence's part-time job previously drew scrutiny because of Immanuel Christian School’s policy of not allowing gay teachers or students. Pence sees the criticism of her teaching at the school as an attack on her faith – and a violation of the religious liberty tenet on which she said the nation was founded. \"I’m just a person who believes in the Bible, so it shouldn’t be right for someone to attack me for my beliefs,\" she told USA TODAY last year. Fact check:Does Mike Pence really call his wife 'Mother'? \"Today is #NationalDogDay!\" Pence tweeted Wednesday. \"We love our furry best friend, Harley! Throwback to when he was just a little puppy.\" In addition to Harley, the Australian shepherd that the vice president got as a Father's Day present in 2017, the Pences have a cat, Hazel. (Both pets' names begin with \"H\" as do their \"parents'' Secret Service code names. The vice president's is \"Hoosier\" and his wife's is \"Hummingbird.\") Their most famous pet is \"Marlon Bundo,\" a rabbit that Charlotte Pence Bond acquired in college that has starred in children's books illustrated by Karen Pence and written by her daughter. Comedian John Oliver created a parody version of the first book to criticize the vice president’s record on gay rights. Charlotte Pence Bond bought a copy, saying people should support both books since the proceeds from both go to charity. More:Marlon Bundo, Vice President Mike Pence's bunny, explains coronavirus guidelines One of the home state touches Pence has added to the vice presidential residence is a half basketball court. It was installed primarily to have a level platform to help with catering outdoor events. But when it was done, the Pences wheeled onto it the portable basketball hoop that had been in the driveway. They also had the logo from the vice president’s favorite sports movie — the story of an underdog Indiana basketball team — applied to what’s now called the “Hoosier court.” The logo, however, isn’t permanent. “The next guy probably isn’t going to want that,” Pence said in 2018. “Unless he’s from Indiana.” Vice Presidential residence:How Karen and Mike Pence — and their pets — have left their mark While Pence was a regular presence at her husband’s side during the 2016 campaign, she has taken on more of her own duties for the re-election effort. Although she’s referred to herself as “kind of the low man on the totem pole,” her outreach to Republican women and fellow Christian conservatives has helped the campaign – as well as helped dispel any doubts about her own commitment to the president. A book about Mike Pence published last year suggested his wife agreed to stick with the 2016 campaign after the release of the “Access Hollywood” video out of the expectation that Trump would probably lose, setting up Mike Pence for his own 2020 bid. Pence has disputed that, saying she loves \"being part of this ticket, part of this administration.”  \"I want to go and do what I can and do my part,\" she told USA TODAY in November. “And they are things that I’m like, 'I can go. I can go do this. Put me in, coach.' \" In addition to detailing Karen Pence’s unhappiness with Trump in 2016, the book “Piety & Power: Mike Pence and the Taking of the White House,” described her concern over how winning would affect the family’s tight finances. “What are we going to do Mike?? We don’t have any money! Who’s going to pay for my inaugural gown??” author Tom LoBianco quoted Karen Pence as saying. Pence's office declined to comment about the book. Trump ended up arranging for the inaugural committee to cover some updates to the vice presidential residence and to buy Karen Pence two ball gowns – an original and the cost of altering that dress into one she liked better, according to the book. Financial disclosure reports show that the Pences have a modest bank account and are paying off loans taken out to help pay for their children's educations.  Before the Pences became the Second Family, they were the self-dubbed “D.C. Hillbillies\" when Mike Pence served in Con They gave themselves that name after over-enthusiastically participating in a Capitol Hill event for congressional families called “Pet Night.” It was a chance for the children of lawmakers to meet famous pets, such as the cat from \"Stuart Little\" or the dog from \"Men in Black.\" The Pences thought it an experience that should be shared with their actual pets – a dog, two cats and a lizard. “I don’t know when exactly our mother found out that we had misjudged Pet Night, but it was most likely at some point after Bud (the dog) tried to run away and before Madeline (the cat) threw up a hairball next to Dad’s foot as he discussed legislation with another freshman congressman,” Charlotte Pence Bond wrote in her 2018 book about her family. The lesson the Pences took away: “If you take yourselves too seriously in D.C., you miss all the fun.”"}, {"id": "usatoday5", "publisher": "usatoday", "label": "left-center", "title": "Crenshaw, 36, is a highly decorated Navy Seal. During a mission in Afghanistan province, a homemade bomb exploded that destroyed Crenshaw's right eye and killed his interpreter.", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/26/rnc-rep-dan-crenshaw-considered-rising-star-republican-party/5637653002/", "section": "news", "date": "2020-08-26-09PM", "body": "WASHINGTON – Freshman Congressman Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, who is considered to be a rising star in the Republican party, spoke Wednesday at the Republican National Convention, calling the United States \"a country of heroes\" but never mentioning President Donald Trump by name.   Crenshaw spoke about heroism and touted American freedom, saying, \"We are a people with a common set of ideals conceived in liberty.

Afterwards, he completed his master’s degree in public administration at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government before being elected in November 2018 to Congress, representing a Houston-area district. He was viewed as an outsider to politics and lauded as a possible \"unifier\" of the parties. He has since become a high-profile critic of Democrats. Crenshaw has supported some of Trump's stances on immigration, such as building a border wall, but also criticized Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. On his Facebook page, Crenshaw slammed then-candidate Trump's \"insane rhetoric\" toward Muslims and \"hateful\" speech.  More:RNC speaker pulled from lineup after boosting QAnon-tied conspiracy about Jewish people Crenshaw gained national attention just days before being elected to Congress when Saturday Night Live comedian Pete Davidson made fun of the eye patch the military veteran has worn since being wounded in Afghanistan. He said in a December 2018 Twitter post that he has a glass eye, but wears the eye patch in public because he’s noticed it’s distracting to people. Amid the outrage over Davidson's remark, Crenshaw shrugged it off as no big deal. But the following week, Crenshaw appeared on the show alongside Davidson to take a few all-in-good-fun potshots at the comedian, accepted his apology and offered some perspective. \"There's a lot of lessons to learn here,\" Crenshaw said. \"Not just that the left and the right can still agree on some things, but also this: That Americans can forgive one another.

They also named the officer and said the results of their investigation will be turned over to a prosecutor. The description of the shooting by the Wisconsin Department of Justice is the first official accounting of what happened in the Sunday shooting in Kenosha that has since spawned nightly protests and public outrage.  Authorities identified the officer as Rusten Sheskey, a seven-year veteran of the Kenosha Police Department. Sheskey fired his weapon seven times into Blake's back as Blake leaned into his car. No other officer at the scene fired a weapon. Blake was also tased, according to DOJ.  The account said Blake told officers he had a knife in his possession, although it is unclear whether Sheskey knew of the knife when he pulled the trigger of his gun. Wisconsin Department of Criminal Investigations officers found a knife in the driver-side floorboard of Blake's car and no other weapons were recovered, according to Wisconsin officials. The department's statement does not say if Blake threatened the officer with the knife.  Earlier in the day, a 17-year-old suspected of fatally shooting two people and wounding a third in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has been arrested as protests over police brutality and the shooting of Jacob Blake continue to rock the city and the country. Court records show Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, faces a first-degree intentional homicide charge in Kenosha County. He is now jailed in Lake County, Illinois, and has been charged there as a fugitive from justice. He will appear for extradition hearing on Friday.  Based on Wisconsin law, Rittenhouse would be charged as an adult.  For three nights, violent protests have torn through Kenosha after a police officer shot Blake from behind at close range while he was getting in a vehicle. Buildings have been burned, windows smashed out and stores looted. Anger over the shooting has spilled into the streets of other cities, including Los Angeles and Minneapolis, the epicenter of the Black Lives Matter movement this summer following George Floyd’s death. On Wednesday evening, protests had historic implications for the sports world as NBA playoff games were postponed after the Milwaukee Bucks didn't take the floor for Wednesday's playoff game against the Orlando Magic. Standing in solidarity with the Bucks, Major League Baseball's Brewers decided not to play Wednesday night's game against the Cincinnati Reds. According to the Wisconsin Department of Justice, the Kenosha Police Department was called out to a residence \"after a female caller reported that her boyfriend was present and was not supposed to be on the premises.\" Officers tried to arrest Blake, deploying a Taser, which was unsuccessful in stopping Blake. Blake \" walked around his vehicle, opened the driver’s side door, and leaned forward.\"  \"While holding onto Mr. Blake’s shirt, Officer Rusten Sheskey fired his service weapon 7 times,\" DOJ said in a statement. \"Officer Sheskey fired the weapon into Mr. Blake’s back. No other officer fired their weapon. Kenosha Police Department does not have body cameras, therefore the officers were not wearing body cameras.\" DOJ said during the investigation following the initial incident, Blake told officers he had a knife. The knife was found in the driver's side floorboard of Blake's car and no other weapons were found.  \"When DCI is the lead investigating agency of a shooting involving a law enforcement officer, DCI aims to provide a report of the incident to the prosecutor within 30 days,\" DOJ said in a statement.  \"The prosecutor then reviews the report and makes a determination about what charges, if any, are appropriate. If the prosecutor determines there is no basis for prosecution of the law enforcement officer, DCI will thereafter make the report available to the public.\" It was previously announced the officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave.  Anticipating continuing unrest, local authorities said a curfew will begin at 7 p.m. on Wednesday — earlier than the previous night's curfew. The new nightly curfew is effective through Sunday. At a press conference Wednesday, local officials expressed support for peaceful protests. Beth said law enforcement will be “very assertive” with enforcing the curfew and that they would be arresting violators. That comes as President Donald Trump promised increased federal involvement and decried \"looting, arson, violence, and lawlessness.\"  FBI agents and U.S. Marshals will be deployed in response to the city's unrest, U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec tweeted. The White House authorized sending 2,000 National Guard troops from other states to Wisconsin. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has also doubled the number of Wisconsin National Guard service members deploying to Kenosha to 500. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, accused Trump of “making matters worse” in Kenosha and elsewhere by encouraging vigilantes. \"What we saw in Kenosha breaks your heart; it does pierce the soul, as was said,” Pelosi said when asked about the unrest. Tuesday's shooting happened at about 11:45 p.m., Kenosha police said. Many people were still on the streets in protest just before the shooting, walking up and down Sheridan Road, where protesters had been driven after being expelled from Civic Center Park. Authorities did not release the victims' names but at a press conference Wednesday afternoon said the two killed were a 26-year-old man from Silver Lake and a 36-year-old Kenosha man. A 26-year-old West Allis man was wounded. Earlier Wednesday, Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that one victim had been shot in the head and another in the chest late Tuesday, just before midnight. Beth didn’t know where the other person was shot, but video posted on social media showed someone had been shot in the arm. 2 shot dead and 1 injured:Police looking for man armed with a long gun Although police have provided few details about what occurred, there are dozens of videos posted to social media that appear to portray the incident. Those videos show a male opening fire in the middle of the street with a semi-automatic rifle and a person being shot in a car lot. In the car lot incident, a young white man is being pursued by someone who tosses an object. Soon, shots ring out, and the pursuer drops.  Several other videos show what seems to be the same person being chased by a handful of people in a street. Someone asks, \"What he'd do?\" and someone yells, \"Hey, he shot him!\" The male with the gun trips and falls onto his back. A few people begin to run at him. Amid a scuffle, shots ring out after someone attempts to grabs the shooter's gun.  That person crumples to the pavement a few feet away and lies still. Another person rushes at the shooter, who appears to strike that person in the arm with another shot. Then, police appear to allow the young man responsible for the shootings — still carrying a gun — to walk past them, while people in the crowd yell for him to be arrested. Beth blamed a chaotic, high-stress scene for that inaction. He said those conditions can cause “tunnel vision” among law officers. Social media videos:Much of Kenosha's deadly protest shooting was captured on video Rittenhouse thought of himself as a militia member trying to protect life and property, according to videos, interviews and social media posts. Video taken in the hours before the shooting shows Rittenhouse hanging out with older armed men, who tell the reporter they're protecting a car lot. Rittenhouse then introduces himself as Kyle. He also did a video interview with the Daily Caller in front of a boarded up building. \"People are getting injured and our job is to protect this business,\" Rittenhouse says in the clip. \"And my job also is to protect people. If someone is hurt, I’m running into harm’s way. That’s why I have my rifle; I’ve gotta protect myself obviously. But I also have my med kit.\" In another video clip, Rittenhouse is shown with members of the group shown earlier, getting bottles of water from a law enforcement officer in an armored vehicle. The officer thanks them for their help, though they are clearly civilians in violation of the city's 8 p.m. curfew. Asked about the interaction during a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth said, \"our deputies would toss water to anybody.\" Body camera footage:Kenosha officials delayed police body cameras for years before Jacob Blake shooting Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian joined other local law enforcement officials on Wednesday afternoon in pleading for protests to remain peaceful. \"People have differences of opinion. We have different concepts on how things should be done, but violence in the community is not acceptable ... Violence to property, violence to people is absolutely unacceptable.\" Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul condemned \"armed vigilantes, arsonists, and other opportunists\" in a Wednesday statement. \"Times like this call for our leaders to unify people. We must come together, in good faith, to work toward positive change. Sowing division can be deadly, and we must condemn those—especially those at the highest level of government—who seek to do so,\" the statement says. Evers — who was criticized by conservatives after White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Tuesday the governor had turned down an offer of federal help from Trump — tweeted condolences for the victims of Tuesday's shooting. \"We cannot let the hateful actions of a few designed to create chaos distract us from our pursuit for a more fair, equitable, and accountable state and country for Jacob Blake and the many others who deserve justice,\" Evers tweeted. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivered his first remarks Wednesday on the shooting of Jacob Blake, saying, \"What I saw in that video makes me sick.\" \"Once again, a Black man – Jacob Blake – has been shot by the police in broad daylight with the whole world watching,\" Biden said in a 90-second video released by his presidential campaign. The former vice president said he spoke by phone to Blake's mother, father, sister and other family members earlier in the day. Vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris was on the call as well, she said.  \"I told them, 'Justice must and will be done,'\" Biden said. \"Our hearts are with his family, especially his children.\" The shooting of Blake on Sunday happened quickly, with less than three minutes elapsing between the time the first officer arrived and shots being fired, according to dispatch audio. Here is a timeline of the shooting pieced together from police radio transmissions, Kenosha police, video and witnesses. The police radio traffic is from Broadcastify, a platform for streaming live audio of public safety, aircraft, rail and marine-related communications.  The Journal Sentinel, a part of the USA TODAY Network, typically does not rely on radio traffic to report on breaking news, as the information can change or be inaccurate. But this audio reveals some of what police officers were hearing, and the time stamps provide a general time frame of the shooting.  Dispatch audio:Jacob Blake was shot less than 3 minutes after Wisconsin police arrived at the scene Police have not released an account of what happened. Kenosha police officers are not equipped with body cameras. Officers have dashboard cameras in their squad cars but authorities did not say if any part of the shooting had been captured on those cameras. The incident is being investigated by the Wisconsin Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation, which has said it will attempt to present its findings to prosecutors within 30 days. Julia Jackson, Blake's mother, told reporters Tuesday that the destruction throughout the city of Kenosha since her son's shooting is extremely disturbing. \"We really just need prayers,” Jackson said. “As I was riding through here, the city, I noticed a lot of damage. It doesn’t reflect my son or my family. If Jacob knew what was going on as far as that goes – the violence and the destruction – he would be very unpleased.\"  Jackson, standing with civil rights attorney Ben Crump, said she was able to see Blake in the hospital and prayed with him. Blake is paralyzed from the waist down and Crump said it would be \"a miracle\" if he ever walks again. 'We really just need prayers':Jacob Blake's mother says son would be 'unpleased' with destruction in Kenosha Crump said Blake was undergoing more surgery Tuesday. One of Crump's fellow attorneys, Patrick Salvi, said it is miraculous Blake is alive after Sunday’s incident and that Blake was hit with “at least seven, as many as eight” bullets and will require lengthy rehabilitation.  “He had a bullet go through some or all of his spinal cord,” Salvi said before announcing plans for a civil lawsuit. “At least one bullet. He has holes in his stomach. He had to have nearly his entire colon and small intestines removed. He suffered damage to his kidney and liver and was also shot in the arm.”  Blake’s father, Jacob Blake Sr., who at one point was too distraught to stay at the press conference, said the family is seeking out child psychologists for the children who saw the shooting.  Contributing: Nick Penzenstadler, USA TODAY; Meg Jones and Joe Taschler, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel; Hayes Gardner, Emma Austin, Lucas Aulbach, Louisville Courier Journal; The Associated Press"}, {"id": "usatoday8", "publisher": "usatoday", "label": "left-center", "title": "Low-end models have been swept up, but if you're willing to pay more, you should be able to get a decent machine.", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/08/25/covid-19-china-trade-war-make-laptops-hard-get-what-do/5622549002/", "section": "tech", "date": "2020-08-26-09PM", "body": "You know things are bad when the Office Depot \"Back to School\" Sunday circular features lots of low-price laptops, and the next day, none is available at any of the stores within 100 miles.

The next challenge? Should they require workers to take vaccines? Some companies concerned about liability issues, health and safety may need to decide whether to force their employees to get vaccinated if they want to continue working or return to the office, experts say. And some experts are already calling on employers to make it mandatory, which, they say, would generally be legal. But others caution against mandates, saying that they could backfire by making Americans more resistant to a vaccine they're already concerned about and more likely to embrace anti-vaxxer sentiment. Three Case Western University professors argued in a recent op-ed for USA TODAY that Americans should be compelled to get vaccinated, saying one option is that \"private businesses could refuse to employ or serve unvaccinated individuals.\" Such a requirement could place employers in conflict with their workers, given that more than 1 in 3 Americans say they wouldn’t get a COVID-19 vaccine today even if it were free and approved by the Food and Drug Administration, according to a Gallup poll conducted July 20 through Aug. 2. The most common reason why some Americans are nervous about the vaccine is the speed with which it's being developed, followed by fears that the risks will outweigh the benefits, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted May 13-19. But while requiring workers to get vaccinated could raise ethical issues – should people be forced to get immunized if they have religious, philosophical or personal objections? – some experts say those can be overcome for the sake of protecting everyone. \"It’s very much in keeping with an employer's responsibility for maintaining the health and wellbeing of its workers to require it,\" said Denise Rousseau, professor of organizational behavior and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. Vaccine race:Could a coronavirus vaccine rehab the pharmaceutical industry's reputation? 2020 flu shot season:Walgreens, CVS pharmacists to check for coronavirus symptoms, wear face shields Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has predicted that a vaccine will be available by late 2020 or early 2021. There are dozens of potential vaccines in the works, including ones from drug companies like Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Merck and GlaxoSmithKline. Dorit Reiss, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, and an expert on vaccine requirements, said she expects certain employers to require the vaccine – potentially including organizations with at-risk workers, such as meat-processing plants and hospitals. \"Legally every employer can require it – you don't have to be a high-risk employer to require it,\" she said. \"On one hand, employers will be concerned about pushback from employees. On the other hand, they’ll also be concerned about COVID outbreaks that can be prevented.\" But some vaccine proponents say that requiring workers to get immunized, even if well-intentioned, would be counterproductive. \"Unfortunately when you go straight to a requirement for something, even though you think it’s wonderful, that just does not go over well with a lot of people,\" said Kelly Moore, associate director for immunization education for the pro-vaccine Immunization Action Coalition.  She said companies shouldn't rush to require vaccination quickly after any COVID-19 vaccine is released. Due to the inevitable lack of long-term health data on the vaccine, she said it's important for employers to follow the guidance of public health professionals as they monitor the impacts and performance of the inoculation.  \"The first thing we do with a new vaccine is educate people about it, answer their questions, monitor how it’s accepted and how it works,\" she said. \"Companies who are trying to do a good thing for their employees will look around and say, 'What does public health recommend?’ And at this stage a requirement for these vaccines would not be recommended.\" To be sure, vaccination requirements aren’t unusual in certain settings. For example, all 50 states require schoolchildren to obtain a certificate of immunization for several vaccines, according to the Immunization Action Coalition, a pro-vaccine advocacy group. Required vaccines included those that prevent tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap); polio; chickenpox; and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). Every state provides exemptions for medical reasons, while some allow exemptions for religious or philosophical reasons.  And most hospitals require workers to get a flu shot every year to help protect themselves and patients. But vaccines for MMR, polio, chickenpox, the flu and other diseases have a long track record of safety that the COVID-19 vaccine won't have when it is first released. “It’s certainly not unheard of” for employers to require vaccines, said Bunny Ellerin, director of the Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Management Program at Columbia Business School. “The issue is there are a number of people who are not going to want to take a vaccine. So I think more likely what people are going to do is strongly suggest it.” Johnny C. Taylor Jr., CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, an HR professional society, said in a recent Q&A for USA TODAY that “generally speaking,” employers are allowed to impose vaccine mandates. “For decades, health care and education employers have required employees to take the flu shot and show proof of other major vaccinations – such as those for tetanus, polio or measles – since they are in close contact with vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly and immunocompromised people,” Taylor wrote. “I predict, because of the damage COVID-19 has done to lives and livelihoods, we will see many more employers in other sectors make this a requirement.” Some exemptions typically apply, including religious reasons. But it’s not necessarily enough for people to express concerns about the health and safety implications of getting vaccinated. Several government agencies did not comment on potential employer mandates when contacted by USA TODAY for this article. The Department of Labor referred questions to the CDC, which referred questions to the Department of Health and Human Services, home to the FDA, which referred questions to the CDC. Instead of requiring vaccination as a condition of employment, employers may take one of several other approaches, experts say. They could: • Require it to work from the office. Legally, employers would be required to make reasonable accommodations for workers who refuse to get vaccinated, Reiss said. Such an accommodation could include allowing them to work from home, which millions of Americans are already doing. • Advocate voluntary inoculation and run vaccination clinics at the workplace. “Bring folks in to make it easy,” Ellerin said. “Make sure there’s no penalty for taking time off to get it done. Just make it really accessible.” • Pay for it. While it’s possible that the federal government will end up picking up the tab, it’s also possible that workers will need to foot part of the bill. Employers should pressure their health care insurance providers to pick up the cost, Ellerin said. Health experts say that it’s vital for a critical mass of Americans to get vaccinated for immunizations to begin defeating COVID-19. While a vaccine is unlikely to be 100% effective against contracting COVID-19, it is likely to help prevent many Americans from getting the disease while reducing the severity of the symptoms for many others. “If we want to decrease deaths, if we want to decrease hospitalizations, if we want to decrease ventilator use, we have to have maximization of the vaccination to be effective,” said Wilbur Chen, chief of the adult clinical studies section at the University of Maryland School of Medicine’s Center for Vaccine Development & Global Health. “At least in those communities that have higher uptake, I’ll expect we’ll have less disease, less cases” and fewer patients who need medical treatment. While the anti-vaxxer movement has gained currency among some Americans in recent months due to their concerns over how fast the process is moving, Chen said he’s confident in the FDA’s expedited procedures for authorizing COVID-19 vaccines. “It’s pretty clear that they’re not skipping over anything,” he said. “They want to have efficacy, they want to have safety, they want to have the vaccine examined in diverse parts of the population by gender, by race, by ethnicity. They want to have all ages evaluated.” That said, experts acknowledge that they won’t have long-term health data for the vaccine until well after it’s been approved for the marketplace.   While most employers will likely spurn mandates, it will be “common sense” for some to require vaccination, such as meat-processing facilities that have experienced outbreaks due to the close proximity of workers in the factory, Ellerin said. “There will be certain environments I believe where you’ll have no choice. If you’re working next to somebody in a factory, I think it’s pretty obvious that you need to do that,” she said, adding that hospitals are another obvious place. Some employers should brace for a fight if they decide to impose mandates on their workers. “On workplace infectious disease exposures, labor has a history of taking the position that employers must offer the vaccine to employees at no cost, but not be mandatory, in order to be safe from workplace exposures associated with their job,” said Rebecca Reindel, safety and health director of the AFL-CIO, a conglomeration of unions, in an email. She added: “We are supportive of individuals/workers getting vaccinated if the vaccines are demonstrated to be safe and effective. This issue also could be subject to collective bargaining rules and workers' representatives would address the tradeoffs and procedures involved in such a decision.” Officials should focus most of their efforts on educating the public about the need to get vaccinated, rather than imposing mandates, said Immunization Action Coalition advocate Moore, a former director of the Tennessee Immunization Program and a former member of the FDA panel that makes recommendations on vaccine policy. “I have seen requirements backfire,” she said. “I learned a lot from our experience with the HPV cancer vaccine. It’s really one where well-intentioned efforts at requirements caused a lot of damage to the public’s trust -- completely accidentally, without intention but with repercussions we’re still dealing with more than a decade after this vaccine came out.” That vaccine – which is “unbelievably effective” and “long-lasting,” Moore said – prevents cancers related to HPV. “But when it was first introduced, a lot of well-intentioned people thought it would be great to require this vaccine immediately because they didn’t want another young girl to face cervical cancer,” she said. “That, unfortunately, became a political football. People began questioning immediately, ‘Why are you requiring me to take something I don’t understand?’” In her home state of Tennessee, legislators responded to talk of a mandate by introducing a bill that would have prohibited health authorities from requiring a vaccine without a vote of the legislature. Moore said that requirements can be helpful, but usually only when there’s a small percentage of holdouts. “In my experience, requirements must be used judiciously and only in concert with broad public acceptance,” she said. She said she “can’t imagine” employers requiring vaccination until long-term data is available on  a COVID-19 vaccine and the FDA provides full licensure, not just emergency authorization, which is likely the first step to launch distribution. Still, employers legally don’t have to wait for full licensure to require vaccination, said Reiss, the UC Hastings expert on vaccine law. They must make exceptions for people for medical reasons. And they must make accommodations for people with religious objections, but not if doing so would “create a direct threat” to other employees or customers, Reiss said. She noted that COVID-19 could be an example of a crisis in which religious exemptions may not be tolerated. “What courts are looking for is a good faith effort to work something out” when objections arise, she said. “You have to show an effort to find a solution.” But if the effort would impose “undue costs,” the employer can maintain the requirement, she said. “Ethically you can say that high-risk employment places may have an obligation and certainly have a very good justification for imposing such a mandate,” she said.

Sometimes. Add cloudy weather, another device or two, an actual comfy chair to work from, and someone trying to watch Netflix or Hulu? Fuhgetaboutit.  It turns out that of all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Alaska has the slowest internet speed in America, according to internet testing firm Ookla, which conducted a speed test for PCMag.com in November 2019. That’s no surprise, given that it’s the Last Frontier and all. Coronavirus crisis:With family learning and working home, your Wi-Fi network may need a boost COVID-19 tracking apps:Supported by Apple and Google, apps begin showing up in app stores What is a surprise though, is just how bad Wi-Fi and slow internet’s been across the map for so many of us during these pandemic times – no matter where we live. Normally, crummy connections are super frustrating – akin to robocalls during dinnertime. But when directly tied to our ability to work, learn, and communicate with the outside world, it's more than annoying. “It’s so frustrating, work that should have taken me two hours took five, or even seven,” 14-year old high school freshman Jordi Alford told me in Oakland, California last week. Jordi, his younger brother Kiran (10), and Alford’s parents left their urban home in mid-March to ride out COVID-19 more remotely in their family’s cluster of cabins in the Sierra Foothills. Alford’s father is recovering from cancer and has COPD, which puts him at an increased risk of serious illness from the coronavirus.  “We were medically advised to leave town,” Jordi’s mom, Anki said. “And being out in the country was so much better for all of us for so many reasons – cleaner air, more access to outside activity – and only family around us. But not having access to reliable internet took its toll,” she added. “They would get through about three sentences of a Zoom lesson with their teacher, then get disconnected with the spinning wheel and have to wait 20, 30, 40 minutes. It was awful,” Anki said.  Fifth grader Kiran agreed. “There’s no Wi-Fi, so we got a Verizon Jetpack and an antenna to boost power,” he told me. “That gave us enough of a signal to go on for about five minutes at a time, but then it would stop, so we were just barely able to do a little tiny bit of work.” As a result, the Alford family came back to Oakland to start the new school year with better Wi-Fi, but against doctor’s orders. “The unfortunate truth is that millions of Americans working, going to school, and living in America’s heartland still don’t have access to high-speed broadband internet e-Connectivity,\" USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue told USA TODAY. “In fact, of the 21 million Americans who lack high-speed broadband internet access, 80% are in rural areas and on tribal lands.”  This isn’t the first time rural areas have suffered. The same thing happened nearly 100 years ago with electricity, too. Back then, it took the U.S. government’s passing of the Rural Electrification Act and the creation of electric cooperatives to make a lasting change.  Historically though, the United States government hasn’t been as proactive with high-speed internet. Instead of treating broadband as a public utility, they leave it up to the largely self-regulated internet industry to provide service.  As a result, internet service providers (ISPs) often don’t see these sparsely populated areas as profitable enough. “My sisters and I all have houses on our family farm in (rural southeastern) North Carolina,\" says John Forlaw, a retired college math teacher. “We can’t get broadband at all. Going there  is like going back in time. There’s no distance learning, Netflix, or telemedicine, which would be very helpful given my mother’s health and this pandemic.”  It’s clear to him that the reason isn’t so much technical as it is financial. “I can see the orange markers designating a buried fiber optic cable owned by Spectrum within the ‘right of way’ on our property,” he says. “But when I call and ask if I can access it, they say no, there is no service here.”  “That’s so infuriating,” says Federal Communications Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel – an outspoken advocate for more equal broadband access for everyone. “As a country, we’ve been told to go online for work, for school, for health care, and for so much more. And the challenge is that not everyone in this country can do that. To me, this is the cruelest part of the digital divide.” Rosenworcel says the problem isn’t just for those living in the country. It hits city-dwellers hard too.  Some 100,000 students lack access to high-speed internet in Chicago. 112,000 residents have no wired internet services available at their New York address. And according to the nonprofit group Tech Exchange, one in every five San Francisco Bay Area residents don’t have an Internet connection at home, even though they live in the shadows of some of the biggest tech companies in the world including Apple, Google, Facebook, Tesla, and Twitter – to name a few.  Even in areas of tremendous wealth, the digital divide is getting worse. In the hardscrabble neighborhood where I live in West Oakland for example, which is a ten minute BART ride away from the doorsteps of dozens of top tech companies, getting high-speed internet delivered to your home is expensive, and so is living here. A starter home sets you back a million dollars, and the average one-bedroom rental is around $3,000.  And this is just one example. 20 million people who do live within the reach of broadband service do not subscribe because they can’t afford to or the speeds they can get are not worth the cost. And about 4.5 million people in urban areas still can’t get access to broadband because of service inadequacies caused by geography or the vagaries of service-provider rollouts. If it sounds like digital redlining, many advocates say, that’s because it is. Similar to residential redlining, this impacts races differently too: Black Americans are less likely than white Americans to have a broadband connection at home, according to the National Digital Inclusion Alliance. While many households in urban areas will be able to rely on generous donations of laptops and Wi-Fi hotspots thanks to some tech companies, many advocates worry it won’t be enough.  “We need to make it a national priority, to get 100% of our households on line,” the FCC’s Rosenworcel says. “It’s essential for modern life and it’s going to be the boost to our economy that we need in the coming years.”  Jennifer Jolly is an Emmy Award-winning consumer tech contributor.

Smartphone apps monitoring location inside a bubble. Daily check-in forms. As hundreds of thousands of students arrive back on campuses across the country, college and university administrators are greeting them with a variety of methods to monitor behavior and discourage large gatherings, all in an effort to keep the students healthy and on campus. Notre Dame and the University of North Carolina recently shut down face-to-face instruction after large gatherings led to COVID clusters. Syracuse University’s leaders said last week that large gatherings left the school on the verge of shutting down and going online only. Even as administrators are coming up with new plans, students are pushing back, saying they are invasions of privacy. They’ve seen some success. At Oakland University in suburban Detroit, a plan to mandate all students wear BioButtons was changed to \"strongly recommend\" after student complaints. “Many students are already hesitant, at best, to be tracked as they stay on campus (and as they leave for the weekend to visit home, go to class, grocery shop, etc.),” a petition from Oakland students that garnered more than 2,400 signatures this summer said. “Masks and socially distancing are understandable ... but this seems like a large overreach in terms of student and staff privacy.” The BioButton is worn by the user and connected to an app on a smartphone. It constantly measures heart rate and temperature, among other things. “We are strongly encouraging a BioButton to be worn because it enhances our broader strategy to monitor the safety of OU's campus,” Oakland’s website said. “We believe it is among the many ways we are keeping you and others safe. However, even if you don’t want to wear the BioButton, there is value in carrying it with you when you are on campus because it can assist with contact tracing.” Colleges and coronavirus:Colleges need COVID-19 tests to reopen, scientists say. Some don't have much of a plan. The BioButton is designed to work as a screening tool for Oakland, said David Stone, Oakland’s chief research officer and a professor of health sciences and philosophy. It will monitor the wearer's breathing rate, heart rate and temperature when the person is at rest. Using artificial intelligence, it will see when there’s a pattern of changes that could indicate an infection. People on campus will also have to answer a series of screening questions each day. Once a day, the system will send Oakland a screen noting the person is green – OK to be on campus – or red, meaning follow-up from the school’s health services is needed. It will send similar updates every six hours to the user through an app on their phone. Coronavirus and schools:New cases are emerging. How much you know depends on where you live. “All the university will see is the cleared/not cleared status,” Stone said. The school will not see the actual data from a user. The button won’t track location, but will know when it is around another user wearing a button. That’s useful in contact tracing. The school hopes the button will help them not have big outbreaks that some other schools are seeing. Some universities are going with less intrusive monitoring apps. At the University of Tennessee, students on campus will be required to \"self screen\" for COVID-19 symptoms each day before leaving their dorms using an app that asks questions about their temperature, any symptoms and if they have been exposed to anyone who is known to have COVID-19. Faculty and staff are also required to do this when they are on campus. At Ohio State University, students and employees will be required to report their body temperature and health status through a mobile app before coming on campus each day. When students at Michigan's Albion College first heard about being required to download an app before coming onto campus, they thought it was just an easy way to schedule COVID-19 tests and then get the results. It wasn’t long before they learned that they had to also turn on a location tracker, which monitors when they leave a several-mile bubble. “I felt betrayed by Albion,” said junior Alexis De La Cruz, an economic major in quarantine at Albion, waiting for her COVID test to come back. “It’s like Albion doesn’t trust us to practice social distancing.” About 97% of the school’s students live on campus. The app is part of the small liberal arts college’s multi-prong approach to the semester, which includes education for students, said Mathew Johnson, the school’s new president. The app allows the school to push out educational material to students, but also includes a geotracking feature, built to help with contact tracing. It also notifies the school when a student leaves a predefined boundary, which is about a 4.5-mile circle around the campus, about 95 miles west of Detroit. The boundary includes the entire city, meaning students can leave campus. It also includes a nature area and other nearby spots. COVID-19, visas, Trump:International students turning away from US colleges for lots of reasons If a student wants to leave the bubble boundary, they can apply for a waiver. De La Cruz says she has seen friends be denied to work outside of the bubble. She also says it will be tough to see her family during the school year. If a student leaves without permission, their student ID is deactivated, which means they can’t get back into college buildings. In order to get it reactivated, the student would have to speak with a staff member. That conversation would be educational and also to make sure the student practiced safe social distancing and mask wearing, Johnson said. If there were repeated violations, the student could go through the normal student justice system, which includes due process. It could lead to a suspension or more. Several schools in Michigan are using some sort of app to monitor students' health. For example, at Eastern Michigan University, student workers were set up at the entrance of buildings during summer school and will be again during fall classes. Anyone coming in will have to show on their smartphone how they completed the form; paper forms will also be available. Parent Michael Coleman, 53, of Ypsilanti, has a son at Eastern and a daughter at Albion. He wonders what will happen with all the data being collected. “Is there some database somewhere that someone can hack and get all the data?” he asked. “I understand they want to keep everyone safe, but it seems like they are starting to go overboard.” In Ann Arbor, the University of Michigan isn’t relying just on technology. The school is also sending police officers – both from the university and the city – into student-heavy neighborhoods. The Ann Arbor Police Department said it was teaming with UM students, staff, faculty and volunteers to patrol campus and neighborhoods around the university to \"serve as a visible presence and reminder to students and other community members of the need to follow public health guidance,\" the department said in a tweet. It comes as the Washtenaw County Health Department tightens restrictions on the number of people who are allowed to gather outdoors in the cities of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, home to UM and Eastern, respectively. \"COVID-19, large gatherings and harmful alcoholic behavior are all concerns this year,\" the police department tweeted. “It’s not really an extension of the police or something,” UM President Mark Schlissel told the student newspaper, The Michigan Daily, in a recent interview. “So, you’ll undoubtedly forget on some occasions to pull your mask over your face as you walk from some part that’s off campus onto campus, or as you rush out of your apartment or a student rushes out of their dorm room. So, these are people that are just going to remind you, and we’re hoping that a lot of enforcement really comes from changing norms. “Students who fail to come into compliance when they’re partying in town after multiple admonitions and many different tiered levels of reminders ultimately will be brought into the student code pathway or receive a citation that will be very expensive to them,” Schlissel said. “But that’s the last resort.” Detroit Free Press staff writer Kristen Jordan Shamus contributed to this report. "}, {"id": "usatoday16", "publisher": "usatoday", "label": "left-center", "title": "Several states have launched COVID-19 tracking apps, built upon contact tracing technology supported by Apple and Google.", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/08/25/google-and-apple-supported-coronavirus-tracking-apps-land-states/3435214001/", "section": "tech", "date": "2020-08-26-09PM", "body": "Four months after Apple and Google announced an unusual collaboration to help public-health authorities track the novel coronavirus, apps built on their privacy-optimized Exposure Notification framework have begun arriving in the U.S. The first, Virginia’s COVIDWISE, debuted Aug. 5. North Dakota and Wyoming shipped their Care19 Alert Aug. 13, Alabama launched its GuideSafe app Aug. 17, and Nevada introduced COVID Trace on Monday. The University of Arizona is testing Covid Watch Arizona, with a statewide release expected soon. They work by sharing anonymous Bluetooth beacons with nearby devices running the same software, tagging those that suggest extended and close contact associated with coronavirus spread, and saving the last 14 days of these records. 'We shouldn’t have to beg':Americans struggle without unemployment aid as Congress stalls on extending benefits Work from home:How to lead when you've never met your team in person A positive test for COVID-19 in one of those states should include a code you enter into the app to upload its close-contact records to a health-authority server that then makes this anonymized data available to all these apps at their daily check-ins. If the app sees one of these reports match its saved list of close contacts, it warns of possible exposure and advises testing and quarantine.  These apps require iOS 13.5 or newer (usable on iPhones as old as 2015’s iPhone SE) or Android 6 or newer (which shipped in 2015), plus support for Bluetooth Low Energy wireless (usually a given). Note that – contrary to widespread misinformation – Apple or Google don’t see these apps’ data. Their code framework also walls off these apps from information other programs collect.  “As we started actually building the app, we realized there were even more limits in place than we had initially known about,” emailed Taylor Smith, a developer with Birmingham, Alabama-based  MotionMobs who worked on GuideSafe. “The biggest one, I think, is that there is no use of the GPS allowed in the app.” (Android does require enabling location services for the Bluetooth component of these apps to work, but they still don’t get geographical data.) As I saw after installing Virginia’s COVIDWISE, these apps require minimal effort. After a few taps of the screen to opt into this tracing, the app essentially vanished. These apps do, however, need widespread adoption – at least 20% of a population, according to the explanation posted for the first app built on Apple and Google’s framework, Latvia’s Apturi Covid.  Virginia’s Department of Health reported that as of Aug. 19, 397,914 people had downloaded COVIDWISE, more than 10% of all state smartphone users between 18 and 65. As of Aug. 18, 19 people had anonymously reported positive test results, but the department did not have a number for the number of exposure warnings sent to app users. Virginia, like many states, has seen delays in test results stretch past a week, a lag Gov. Ralph Northam recently called “unacceptable.”   Emily Gurley, an epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, noted that these apps’ automatic estimates of close contacts ignore such nuances as whether a person was indoors or outdoors.  She warned against thinking that installing them makes you safer, saying, “you also have to be working to reduce contact.” These apps also don’t necessarily work across state lines, but help is coming from a nationwide server initiative launched by the Association of Public Health Laboratories, a Silver Spring, Maryland, group. North Dakota and Wyoming’s Care19 app already uses it, and Virginia’s COVIDWISE will soon, said Jeff Stover, Virginia's Department of Health executive program advisor.  But even with these issues in mind, Gurley endorsed installing these apps.  “I feel very strongly about our responsibility towards each other,” she said. “So I’m all in on that.” Rob Pegoraro is a tech writer based in Washington, D.C.

Dr. Susan Bailey, president of the American Medical Association, said the new guideline is \"a recipe for community spread and more spikes in coronavirus.\" She urged the CDC to release the \"scientific justification\" for the change. The CDC estimates in its COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios that 40% of infections are asymptomatic and 50% of transmissions occur before symptoms appear. Experts worry that failing to test asymptomatic carriers could not only result in more infections but also hinder contact tracing efforts. “If being in close personal contact with an infected person … isn’t sufficiently important enough to get tested, I don’t see that there’s any value in contact tracing,” said Peter Pitts, president of the nonprofit Center for Medicine in the Public Interest. A spokesperson at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told CNN the change wouldn’t “undermine contact tracing or any other types of surveillance testing.” Rapid testing:Inaccurate results from rapid COVID-19 tests raise concerns about widespread screening Coronavirus vaccine:Should employers force workers to get COVID-19 vaccine? Some experts say they should Though Pitts said the change in CDC guidelines “is not permission to do away with testing,” he’s worried that some may take it that way. He said the agency should  encourage more testing. Dr. Brett Giroir, HHS Assistant Secretary for Health, said during a news conference Wednesday that the guidance is meant to encourage more \"appropriate testing, not less testing.\"  \"There will be more asymptomatic testing in areas where it's needed and less where it's not needed,\" he said. \"As (the virus) goes down dramatically in certain areas, the need for testing goes down.\"  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi promised to investigate the change, calling the new guideline \"scary and dangerous.\" “It really is very sad and just reinforces the lack of attention and understanding that we have to have in order to crush this virus,\" she said. Scientists recommend more testing — 3 million a day — to identify, track and treat those who are infected, Pelosi said. The country has conducted about 80 million tests total since the pandemic began.  Giroir said the guidelines were reviewed by the Coronavirus Task Force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Stephen Hahn.  \"There was no weight on the scale by the president or the vice president or Secretary (Alex) Azar,\" he said. The guidelines were the product of scientific and medical staff, he said, and  they were \"discussed extensively at the task force and everyone approved it.

She added that she is moved by how Americans have dealt with \"such an unfamiliar and often frightening situation.\" Mass evacuations ahead of a major hurricane are usually enough of a challenge. But as Hurricane Laura barrels toward the Texas coast, officials have to take coronavirus safety precautions into account as well. As a result, more than 385,000 residents told to flee Beaumont, Galveston and Port Arthur are being urged to seek safety in the isolation of hotel rooms if they can, not the temporary communal living of shelters.  State officials said buses deployed to the coast were stocked with personal protective equipment and disinfectants. Buses would make more trips and carry fewer passengers in order to keep people farther apart ahead of the storm's projected landfall Wednesday night or Thursday morning. For those who must stay in shelters, virus testing teams will also be deployed “as soon as practical,” said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management.  Officials are also sounding warnings about outrageous behavior. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards says please just don't to Louisiana residents thinking of planning a hurricane party. Colleges are coming up with some novel ways — both high and low tech — to try to ensure students aren't involved in behavior that puts them at risk for the coronavirus, but they're getting pushback over privacy. A variety of methods are being tried to monitor behavior and discourage large gatherings, from special police patrols in student-heavy neighborhoods to smartphone apps that monitor health information that can be read by campus authorities. All come as campuses have seen clusters of COVID-19 outbreaks that have led some to cancel the start of in-class instruction. At Oakland University in suburban Detroit, administrators hatched a plan to mandate all students wear BioButtons, which measure heart rate and other vital signs and share the data once a day to the college via a smartphone app. But the plan was nixed after a student outcry. Ann Arbor, home to the University of Michigan, is sending campus and city police officers for special patrols in student-heavy neighborhoods.

In the Maui town of Paia, the community association estimates 40% of 71 shops and restaurants are either temporarily or permanently shuttered, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. In Old Koloa Town on Kauai, a collection of historic buildings, a handful of 19 shops and restaurants have closed.  “Ninety-five percent of our projects rely on tourism, and I don’t see there being any replacement of that. We’re more or less in a hold-your-breath situation until tourism returns,” said Cory Beall, president of the Beall Corp. that owns the complex. Health restrictions including a 14-day mandatory quarantine for visitors arriving from outside the state. They havee crippled the tourism industry that accounts for about 25% of Hawaii’s economy. In June alone, visitor arrivals were down 98.2% compared to a year ago, according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority. Wisconsin’s statewide mask mandate should be immediately ended because Gov. Tony Evers didn’t have the legal authority to order it, three western Wisconsin residents represented by a conservative law firm argue in a lawsuit filed Tuesday. It’s the first legal challenge to the mask order Evers issued to help slow the spread of the coronavirus after cases began to spike again in mid-June. Evers issued the order on July 30, it took effect Aug. 1, and is set to run until Sept. 28. The order requires everyone age 5 and older to wear a mask while indoors, except at home. Violators could be fined $200. The three plaintiffs are represented by the conservative law firm the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty. Evers’ spokeswoman Britt Cudaback accused Republicans and their allies of trying to prevent the governor from keeping people healthy and safe. The lawsuit contends that the legal challenge is about Evers’ authority, not whether the state should act to slow the spread of COVID-19 or whether there can be a mask mandate. If Evers wanted to enact a mask mandate, he could have done so with the Legislature’s approval, not by issuing an executive order, said Rick Esenberg, president of the law firm bringing the challenge. Cross-border commuters reported more than four-hour wait times at international bridges, with some waits as long as eight hours, over the weekend as U.S. Customs and Border Protection closed inspection lanes and increased scrutiny to discourage nonessential travel. Border restrictions issued by the Department of Homeland Security in March already prohibit crossing for tourism or recreation. In practice, Mexican nationals who hold a B1/B2 tourist card have been barred from crossing to the United States, while U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents have been permitted to return stateside. As economies on both sides of the border have opened in recent weeks, border crossings have increased. – Lauren Villagran, El Paso Times Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Tuesday apologized for overstating the life-saving benefits of treating COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma. Scientists and medical experts have been pushing back against the claims about the treatment since President Donald Trump’s announcement on Sunday that the FDA had decided to issue emergency authorization for convalescent plasma, taken from patients who have recovered from the coronavirus and rich in disease-fighting antibodies. The announcement raised suspicions that it was politically motivated to offset critics of the president's handling of the pandemic. Hahn had echoed Trump in saying that 35 more people out of 100 would survive the coronavirus if they were treated with the plasma. That claim vastly overstated preliminary findings of Mayo Clinic observations. – Matthew Perrone and Deb Riechmann, Associated Press American Airlines warned in July that it would have to lay off up to 25,000 flight attendants, pilots and other front line workers this fall due to the steep decline in travel brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. The final number came in lower thanks to voluntary employee exits and leaves but the figure is still staggering: 17,500 workers. That is in addition to 1,500 management and administrative workers already laid off. The only thing that will stop the layoffs, the company said, is an extension of the payroll protection program the government approved earlier this year to support key industries until travel demand returned. Travel demand hasn't returned in sufficient numbers, however, and airline unions are fighting to extend the payroll protection, and thus any layoffs, through March 31.  – Dawn Gilbertson The global tourism industry has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, with $320 billion lost in exports in the first five months of the year and more than 120 million jobs at risk, the U.N. chief said Tuesday. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a policy briefing and video address that tourism is the third-largest export sector of the global economy, behind fuels and chemicals, and in 2019 it accounted for 7% of global trade. “It employs one in every 10 people on Earth and provides livelihoods to hundreds of millions more,” he said. But the U.N. chief said that in the first five months of 2020, because of the pandemic, international tourist arrivals decreased by more than half and earnings plummeted.  Guterres said this has been a “major shock” for richer developed nations “but for developing countries, it is an emergency, particularly for many small island developing states and African countries.” – Associated Press Two fraternities at Florida Gulf Coast University have been suspended after allegedly throwing large, off-campus parties Friday night, ignoring the school's new COVID-19 health and safety rules.  School officials were made aware of the events held by Sigma Chi and Phi Delta Theta fraternities, which were allegedly \"not compliant with the university’s COVID-19 health and safety measures for crowd size, masks and social distancing,\" said Susan Evans, chief of staff for the Fort Myers-based university.  The two organizations are now cut off from normal activities, including holding meetings and recruitment efforts, until adjudicated through the process outlined in the student code of conduct. Last week, the university re-opened to in-person classes. The university has about 15,000 students enrolled in fall courses, which are being offered in a variety of virtual and face-to-face options. – Pamela McCabe, Fort Myers News-Press Eight-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt has tested positive for COVID-19, a top Jamaican public health official confirmed in a news conference Monday night. The sprinter previously said in a statement on social media Monday that he took a COVID-19 test on Saturday, one day after celebrating his 34th birthday, and was waiting on the result. \"I'm trying to be responsible, so I'm going to stay in and stay away from my friends,\" Bolt said in the message, which he posted early Monday afternoon. \"I'm having no symptoms (but) am going to quarantine myself.\" Nationwide News Network, a Jamaican radio station, first reported that Bolt had tested positive Monday morning. Bolt is the latest notable athlete to contract COVID-19, which has infected more than 23 million people worldwide, according to data from the World Health Organization. Jamaica has recorded 1,529 cases of COVID-19 to date. – Tom Schad The hundreds of thousands of bikers who attended the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally may have departed western South Dakota, but public health departments in multiple states are trying to measure how much and how quickly the coronavirus spread in bars, tattoo shops and gatherings before people traveled home to nearly every state in the country. From the city of Sturgis, which is conducting mass testing for its roughly 7,000 residents, to health departments in at least six states, health officials are trying to track outbreaks from the 10-day rally which ended on Aug. 16.  An analysis of anonymous cell phone data from Camber Systems, a firm that aggregates cell phone activity for health researchers, found that 61% of all the counties in the U.S. have been visited by someone who attended Sturgis, creating a travel hub that was comparable to a major U.S. city. Health departments in four states, including South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska and Wyoming, have reported a total of 81 cases among people who attended the rally. South Dakota health officials said Monday they had received reports of infections from residents of two other states — North Dakota and Washington. The Department of Health also issued public warnings of possible COVID-19 exposure at five businesses popular with bikers, saying it didn’t know how many people could have been exposed.

Widespread testing can identify people who have the virus and halt the spread of some new cases. But because no test is infallible, some cases will be missed, and some people will be forced to miss work after false positives.  Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said this month he tested positive on a rapid diagnostic to detect the COVID-19 virus before he was to greet President Donald Trump at a Cleveland airport. Two follow-up tests using a more precise, lab-based test showed the governor didn't have the virus. In Maine, 19 summer campers tested positive last month using a rapidantigen test, only to be cleared by the state's lab test, the Bangor Daily News reported.  It's a scenario that will \"come up over and over again,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.   \"We are going to blanket the country with tests,\" said Nuzzo, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"A lot of the push around testing has really been approached from a tech-forward perspective with a goal of trying to reopen our economy and not necessarily thinking through what the consequences are.\" Without a vaccine to prevent COVID-19, the nation has relied on testing to identify who has the virus and must be isolated. Everyone else is urged to keep their distance from others, wear masks and wash their hands. Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir said the USA should have up to 90 million tests in September – an average of about 3 million tests each day. As many as 40 million tests will be \"point of care\" tests with rapid results. The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to three rapid antigen test manufacturers to diagnose COVID-19: Quidel, LumiraDx and Becton, Dickinson. The Trump administration invoked the Defense Production Act last week on federal contracts with Quidel and Becton to expedite production of antigen testing machines that can provide immediate results for 14,000 nursing homes. The effort \"is our highest priority to save lives,\" Giroir said. The National Institutes of Health issues grants through a $1.5 billion \"Shark Tank\"-style competition called Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics. The goal is to bring capacity up to 6 million daily tests by December. 'States duking it out for supply': Lack of federal plan leads to coronavirus testing delays COVID-19 testing capacity and supplies are strained, so some labs turn to sample pooling to meet demand 'Totally unacceptable': Testing delays force labs to prioritize COVID-19 tests for some, not others Lab experts worry the push to test millions of Americans every day, without policies on how to use and interpret results, could confuse people who get conflicting answers, as it happened at the Vermont clinic. PCR tests detect the virus's genetic material. They find even low levels of the virus, so they have been the diagnostic test for public health and clinical labs since the beginning of the pandemic.  Antigen tests detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus. Testing materials are cheaper and more plentiful, and the tests are fast, delivering results in 15 minutes. They're less sensitive than PCR tests and more likely to miss a case.  Because no test is always accurate, doctors who analyze test results must consider other factors, such as how widespread the virus is in a community. If someone tests positive but shows no symptoms, has no known exposure and lives in a community with relatively few cases, it's difficult for a doctor to interpret that result. \"The false negative and false positive rates for any test are never zero,\" said Dr. Dwayne Breining, executive director of Northwell Labs. On July 1, an 18-year-old on a family vacation from New York, who had displayed symptoms for four days, tested positive at Manchester Medical Center in Vermont. Five more people tested positive July 10. Those initial cases emerged during the town's busy tourist season, potentially infecting others at gatherings such as barbecues, soccer games, restaurants and bars. Through July 17, 64 people tested positive and about half of them had symptoms, said Janel Kittredge, Manchester Medical Center's chief medical officer and owner. The clinic faxed the results of each positive antigen test nightly to the Vermont Department of Health. For a case to be listed as official, Vermont requires confirmation with a PCR test.  The state Health Department said it could confirm just four cases from the Manchester clinic. The state set up a pop-up clinic to test hundreds of others before concluding there were no signs of an outbreak. San Diego-based Quidel said it conducted its own investigation and found no issues with the clinic or the company's tests. It shared results with the state Health Department, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FDA.  The FDA informed Vermont it found no issues with Quidel's instruments or how they were used, the Vermont Department of Health said.  It's unclear what information the FDA reviewed, but a spokesman said no recall is warranted and the agency is \"continuing our evaluation.\" Vermont Health Commissioner Mark Levine said Friday it was inappropriate for the Quidel executive to question the accuracy of the state's PCR test. His agency said PCR \"remains a very reliable test\" and people should be confident in its results. Discrepancies among different testing methods are common in the lab industry. The difference with COVID-19 is the nation has never attempted to test such a large portion of the population. Never have such large groups of Americans been ordered to quarantine based on test results. \"If you test enough people, you will get a false positive; you will get a false negative with any test,\" Breining said. \"And the question is now, what are going to be the consequences of it? How do you manage it?\" Breining said his son attends a school in Manhattan with about 3,000 students. One proposal for New York City schools would require all students in a classroom to quarantine if one tests positive. If a student in another classroom tests positive, the entire school would shut down for two weeks. Routine, inexpensive testing of New York City students, teachers and staffers would allow schools to quickly identify new cases. Schools would sometimes close based on test results that might be inaccurate. The key is to develop policies that require a confirmation test to gauge whether the  initial test is accurate, Breining said. The Maine Health Department did not identify the summer camp with 19 false positives, but other camps took notice. Camp Modin, which served about 360 kids from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and other states, concluded camp without a single case. Organizers met with epidemiologists for months to carefully plan multiple rounds of testing, cleaning protocols and who would be allowed on the grounds. Campers were tested three times – a lab test before they arrived, a rapid test at the camp and another lab test days later. One camper tested positive after arriving, but medical staff concluded it was a false positive after the child was tested seven times. Nevertheless, the child was isolated in a medical unit until there were no signs of COVID-19. The camp operated as a bubble without allowing anyone in or out. Staff arrived two weeks before the start of camp and also underwent three rounds of tests. “Everyone bought into it,” said Howard Salzberg, the camp’s executive director. “Ironically, this is the healthiest summer we’ve ever had.” Inaccurate results could harm caregivers or nursing home assistants who take care of vulnerable patients. \"Clearly, the example of a nursing home, we would want to know very quickly if somebody is bringing the virus in there,\" Nuzzo said. \"But there are also consequences to inaccurately identifying somebody who has to stay home and is unable to work, possibly putting patients at risk because of the shortages in the workforce.\" Sherry Perry, a certified nursing assistant, works in a nursing home and has a second job as a home health aide. The Lebanon, Tennessee, resident agrees testing is vital to protect vulnerable residents and health care workers. But she said it's financially devastating when nursing assistants must take unpaid leave when they test positive, despite questions about the accuracy of some tests.  Perry had to take a week off work after a co-worker tested positive. She was not paid but had enough savings to tide her over. Other colleagues struggle.  \"Most CNAs (nursing assistants) are living check to check,\" said Perry, who is co-chair of the National Association of Health Care Assistants.  Some nurses use vacation time and sick days during quarantine, leaving less flexibility to take time off for other reasons.\"Our job is not only physical but emotional, too,\" Perry said. \"We get burned out really easily.\" Nursing homes in New Hampshire and Texas have reported false positives. In Connecticut, errors at the state lab meant 90 people, including nursing home residents, registered false positives from mid-June through mid-July. Such inaccurate results can disrupt operations and waste resources. However, industry representatives said widespread testing is critically important to protect residents and workers. Mark Parkinson, president and CEO of the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, said the bigger challenge this summer has been getting timely results to patients and staff.  In July, more Americans sought tests than the nation's labs could process in a timely manner. There are signs that the bottleneck is improving. Two major commercial labs, Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, said average turnaround times have improved. Nursing homes need rapid antigen tests to provide quick results to residents and staff, Parkinson said. If test results are inaccurate, nursing homes should retest samples to correct errors. \"You can always retest a positive result to get a confirmation,\" Parkinson said. \"It's accurate to say the antigen tests are not as precise as the PCR tests. But the speed of getting results probably outweighs the disadvantage of their slightly reduced accuracy.\"  Some experts want the FDA to loosen oversight of rapid tests that can be taken at home and deliver immediate results, albeit without the sensitivity or accuracy of lab tests.  Michael Mina, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said more inexpensive, at-home tests will be accurate enough to detect when somebody is infectious.  PCR testing can pick up signs of the virus even when somebody is no longer infectious, he said. That means some people are unnecessarily quarantined after they recovered. \"The travesty is that we’re spending so much time focusing on capturing people over here by mistake that we’re missing the people who are actually infected, and those are the people we really should be quarantining,\" Mina said. Dr. Rachel Levine, the Pennsylvania secretary of health, agreed rapid tests at clinics and homes could be an important tool to stop COVID-19. \"We’ll see if that is available by the end of this year,\" Levine said.  Gov. Tom Wolf announced a medical device company, OraSure Technologies, will expand in Pennsylvania and is working to develop a rapid antigen test. The company expects to seek FDA's emergency use authorization by September, aiming to bring the test to the market before the end of the year. Others said the bigger challenge rests not with the technology but with deciding how to manage and interpret results that are not always correct. That requires coordination, Breining said, \"preferably at the national level, that up until now, we’ve demonstrated we are incapable of doing effectively.\"  Contributing: Karen Weintraub Ken Alltucker is on Twitter as @kalltucker or can be emailed at alltuck@usatoday.com"}, {"id": "usatoday20", "publisher": "usatoday", "label": "left-center", "title": "As students return for fall semester, colleges have different plans for testing for COVID-19.

But just how big those interruptions are – and whether the outbreaks can be contained – hinges in part on colleges’ plans to test students rapidly.  And some campuses don’t have much of a plan at all. The approaches vary nationally. Some institutions, like the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, plan to screen thousands of people daily using new federally approved tests that rely on saliva rather than invasive nose swabs. Others, like Notre Dame or Purdue, required students to test negative for the virus before they were even allowed to set foot on campus.  But the University of Northern Georgia skipped mass testing for students coming back to campus and is instead simply asking students who develop COVID-19 symptoms to stay home from class. And Liberty University’s plan to test only people who have symptoms, without testing possibly asymptomatic carriers, has drawn criticism from other universities slated to play the Virginia institution in football. No college’s approach is the same. That’s thanks in part to contradictory federal guidance on mass testing for higher education. The Centers of Disease Control, in guidance updated June 30, said such efforts are unproven and that it “does not recommend entry testing of all returning students, faculty, and staff.”  In contrast, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus coordinator, recently said universities should implement entry tests and be prepared to test up to 10,000 people a day, the Center for Public Integrity reported.  Most universities’ plans fall somewhere between the no-testing and constant monitoring approaches. The consequences of each approach will play out in real time, said Amesh A. Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins’ Center for Health Security. “This isn’t something we have worked out,” he said.  Adalja questioned how effective a massive testing campaign would be if people were still allowed to come and go from the university when they pleased. (Many of the outbreaks on college campuses so far have been tied to off-campus gatherings.) COVID-19 outbreaks:The virus will hit colleges this fall. So why reopen at all? Money is a factor. In any case, most universities are unlikely to be able to reopen safely, no matter what their testing approach is, said A. David Paltiel, a professor at Yale’s School of Public Health. He recently built a mathematical model to track the spread of the virus on college campuses. He found scenarios in which universities can open safely, he said, but “it’s an incredibly high bar. It’s probably one that most universities can’t reach.” And one of the requirements for reaching that bar? Frequent testing, up to every two days in some cases.  In no scenario, the report reads, would “symptom-based screening alone ...  be sufficient to contain an outbreak.”  Without clear federal guidance, students and families must assess whether a college’s plan is sufficient. Campuses are going to have cases, but that doesn’t mean the situation is out of control, Adalja said. He said families may want to consider how robust a university’s plan is compared with similar institutions. And he said colleges ought to set up their courses such that students can feel comfortable switching between in-person and virtual learning should they get sick.  As it is, universities’ testing plans are changing frequently. Testing students before they came to campus was a crucial part of the University of Notre Dame’s plan to launch in-person fall classes. The private Indiana university sent tests to roughly 12,000 people ahead of their return to campus. Fewer than 1% of them tested positive for the virus. The university said those results were encouraging.  They didn’t last.  As the university reopened, cases climbed rapidly within the first week. Administrators blamed the outbreak on students who went to off-campus parties. To slow the spread, the university paused in-person classes for two weeks and increased testing of random people on campus.  What went wrong:How Notre Dame's back-to-campus plan unraveled Purdue University had planned to test students only before they came back, and then if they reported symptoms. But the institution has since altered its plans to try to test 10% of the population every week. The change in plans comes just days after the university suspended dozens of students in connection to an off-campus party. Smaller campuses are changing plans too, as outbreaks pop up at colleges around the country. The College of Charleston hadn’t planned to require students to be tested before returning to campus, but has since required those moving to campus to do so. The situation was the same for the University of the South in Tennessee, which now will require students to take a test on campus before they can move into their dorms. Others plan to test their communities aggressively and require compliance for anyone who wants to be on campus. The University of Illinois started class Monday with plans to use a newly developed saliva test to check up to 20,000 people a day. The method doesn’t rely on nasal swabs, and produces results in an hour, according to the university.  “The faster we can notify people, the faster we can stop the spread,” said Rebecca Lee Smith, a pathology professor at the university.  Some communities may be targeted more than others. For example, the University of Kentucky has already tested much of its student body, but it plans to retest students in Greek organizations. The university found that those students have a higher rate of infection compared with their peers, after outbreaks last week began at fraternities and sororities around the country.  'Safe but still having fun':Colleges hope off-campus housing doesn't doom fall semester Of course, not every university has the research capabilities of a public flagship university like Illinois.  Some colleges are relying on third-party testers, like the Broad Institute, which is working with colleges in Massachusetts, or the Just Project, which has provided testing equipment to historically Black universities.  Still others are taking a looser approach that transfers a large share of the responsibility for managing the virus’ spread to its community members.  The University of Northern Georgia, for example, said its health services division will test only symptomatic patients. Officials have also asked that people planning to come to campus monitor themselves for high temperatures or COVID-19 symptoms. In explaining its testing policy, the university specifically cited the CDC guidance that said mass testing was not recommended.  Arkansas State University wants its students to fill out a form before receiving further instructions about whether and where they should be tested. The University of Southern Indiana’s plan asks that anyone who may have coronavirus fill out a form, stay off campus and call their doctor.  Paltiel said he was wary of universities relying solely on symptomatic tracking. That’s like calling the fire department after a blaze has already consumed a building, he said. His team’s research found no scenario where testing solely based on symptoms was sufficient to prevent wider outbreaks. “You can’t play catch up with this virus,” he said.  Paltiel also criticized the CDC’s guidance and said the agency was wrong in its assessment that mass testing wasn’t necessary, given the large role that people without obvious symptoms play in spreading the virus.  And a re-entry test alone is insufficient to prevent outbreaks, he said. Universities that lack the capacity, or are unwilling, to test large numbers of people regularly, he said, “have no business reopening,\" he said.

Infection rates are falling enough that Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday that soon he will announce plans for reopening businesses that closed nearly two months ago when cases spiked. Newsom called it a “very difficult period, where we’re battling this pandemic as we’re battling these wildfires all up and down the state of California.” More than 100,000 people are tested for COVID-19 every day, though the wildfires have made it more difficult in some places, the Democratic governor said. Over the past week, the infection rate for those tested fell to 5.6%, a significant drop from a few weeks ago and well below the state’s target of 8%. Hospitalizations are down 20% over a two-week period, Newsom said. There are 4,467 hospitalized with the virus, the lowest figure in two months. Isabella County, home to Central Michigan University, has declared a health emergency as COVID-19 cases continue to grow after large parties by students. “We have seen a large increase in cases since students returned to the Mt. Pleasant area. Our investigations have shown that the majority of these cases had attended large social gatherings,” said Steve Hall, health officer for the Central Michigan District Health Department, in a statement. County data shows that in the third week of August there was a 350% increase in the number of COVID-19 cases compared with the previous week, when students were moving in. Central Michigan is running face-to-face classes. During that third week, 92% of reported cases were among those aged 18 to 24, the health department said in a statement. In the first two weeks of August, only 39% of cases were in the college student age range. —David Jesse, Detroit Free Press Fried chicken chain KFC is suspending use of its longtime slogan, \"It's Finger Lickin' Good,\" due to the pandemic, it said Monday. The slogan has been used in its advertising for 64 years.

Ron DeSantis and state Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran that would have reopened schools despite the coronavirus pandemic.   Dodson wrote in his decision that the Florida Education Association established that irreparable harm would be caused if schools were to reopen on a date set by state officials.  Schools should “reopen when the local decision-makers determine” it isto do so upon advice of medical experts without the threat of a financial penalty from the state affecting the decision, he wrote. —James Call The Republican National Convention has begun in a setting that planners believe will keep delegates and officials safe from the coronavirus -- if they follow the rules. Only 336 delegates, a far cry from the thousands that would have come, are in the Charlotte Convention Center for the week-long event. Safety measures were guided by a 42-page health and safety plan developed by a hired doctor. Attendees are supposed to six-foot social distancing and wear masks – though many were seen openly flouting those rules Monday morning. They filled out a pre-travel health questionnaire and participate in a daily symptom tracker. . The Republican National Committee has also committed to contacting every participant five, 14 and 21 days after the event to check on potential symptoms. In remarks to the delegates, Trump panned the state’s Democratic governor for restrictions put in place to try to prevent the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 175,000 people in the country and infected millions. Trump accused Gov. Roy Cooper of “being in a total shutdown mode,” and claimed the restrictions were aimed at trying to hurt his campaign. Eleven students were suspended by Montclair State University in New Jersey for COVID-19 rule violations, according to communications sent to staff and students.  A text message reading \"Is the Next Message You Want to Get: Pack Your Bags and Go Home?\" was sent to students this weekend. It said students had \"gathered in large groups to party without masks and social distancing.   \"Please understand, there will be no second chances,\" the text read. \"Any student who violates the safety protocols will be immediately suspended from housing (possibly for the remainder of the year), will be referred to the Director of Student Conduct for disciplinary action and will be immediately de-registered from any courses or programs that have an on-campus component.\" It also warned there won't be any refunds.  According to spokesman Andrew Mees the university is one the few in the state to bring students not only back onto campus, but into the dorms. – Julia Martin, Montclair Times New York will set up COVID-19 testing sites for incoming passengers at its two largest airports as part of the latest effort to stop travelers from bringing the coronavirus to the state. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Monday the sites slated for John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports in Queens, saying it will allow the state to more quickly determine whether incoming travelers have the virus at the center of a global pandemic. New York was the hardest-hit state in the early days of the pandemic, with more than 24,000 state residents succumbing to confirmed COVID-19 cases since the beginning of March.  – Jon Campbell, Rochester Democrat & Chronicle Fifteen of the NFL’s 32 teams have so far ruled out spectators to start the season, but the Miami Dolphins won't be one of them. The Dolphins are one of at least eight teams hoping to have a limited number of spectators, allowing up to 13,000 socially distancing fans to attend their home opener against the Buffalo Bills on Sept. 20. The same plan will be followed for the University of Miami’s home opener against UAB at the Dolphins’ stadium on Sept. 10. Crowd size will be about 20% of the stadium’s 65,326-seat capacity, with the limitation imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Groups of spectators will be spaced 6 feet apart. The first substantiated case of coronavirus reinfection was reported Monday by researchers at the University of Hong Kong, who say a 33-year-old man was infected by SARS-CoV-2 in late March and then was infected again by a different strain of the virus four and half months later while traveling in Europe. While the case study suggests coronavirus reinfection is possible, experts have said more data is needed to determine if this is a more rare or common occurrence. However, it does underscore the importance of a vaccine instead of relying on herd immunity through mass infection. “Since reinfection can occur, herd immunity by natural infection is unlikely to eliminate #SARSCoV2,” tweeted Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology at Yale University. “The only safe and effective way to achieve herd immunity is through vaccination.” Iwasaki also points out that while the man didn’t have enough antibodies to prevent reinfection, other elements of his immune system were able to defend against illness as he was asymptomatic. From another expert: This is good news  – News wires, Karen Weintraub The World Health Organization announced that 172 countries are looking to participate in COVAX, a global initiative aimed at working with vaccine manufacturers to provide equitable access to safe vaccines once licensed and approved. The global vaccine plan includes nine candidate vaccines, with an additional nine under evaluation. The news comes as countries that had gone weeks without community transmission are seeing clustered outbreaks.  South Korea reported its 11th straight day of triple-digit daily jumps, forcing the country to ban larger gatherings, shut down nightspots and churches and removed fans from professional sports nationwide. New Zealand’s prime minister says the two-week lockdown of the country’s largest city, Auckland, will last an extra four days as authorities try to stamp out an outbreak that appeared after 102 days without any community transmission of the virus. With the onset of the coronavirus, states and organizations are working on a plan to shelter people displaced during the summer wildfire and hurricane season.  Rather than eating and sleeping in large, open rooms, many of those displaced by the the wildfires are being sent to nearby hotels, said Nicole Maul, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross, which operates numerous shelters up and down California in areas hit by wildfires. The agency continues to use congregate centers, but accepts less evacuees to increase social distancing. They also cannot accept dropped-off donations and serve meals in individual packages instead of buffet style.  Depending on expected landfall of Tropical Storms Marco and Laura, The Louisiana Department of Health tweeted Monday that COVID-19 testing will be paused through Tuesday, and may be extended through Wednesday, according to their tweet. Gov. John Bel Edwards said the state plans to activate large shelters with congregate settings only \"as a last resort,\" and instead work with the federal government to use hotels and motels if large evacuations become necessary. – Damon Arthur and Angelaydet Rocha, Redding Record Searchlight; John Bacon and Greg Hilburn, USA TODAY The World Health Organization says using plasma from the recovered to treat COVID-19 is still considered an “experimental” therapy and that the preliminary results showing it may work are still “inconclusive.” WHO’s chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said the treatment is difficult to standardize since people produce different levels of antibodies and the plasma must be collected individually from recovered patients. Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to WHO’s director-general, warned of numerous possible side effects, from a mild fever and chills to more severe lung-related injuries. U.S. infectious disease experts echo WHO's caution.  Trump called a news conference Sunday to announce his administration has granted emergency use authorization for treatment using blood plasma, though more than 70,000 patients have already received it on an experimental basis \"This is a powerful therapy,\" Trump said, describing the authorization as \"a very historic breakthrough.\" – David Jackson, Adrianna Rodriguez, Associated Press The Iowa Department of Public Health reported the state's first child death from COVID-19 on Sunday. The 5-year-old child died in June and had \"significant underlying health conditions,\" officials announced in a news release. The department said the state's medical examiner completed its investigation on August 6. Officials performed a number of tests that take months to complete but found that COVID-19 was the cause of the child's death. The announcement comes one day before some schools prepare to start the new year on Monday. Gov. Kim Reynolds ordered schools to reopen for at least 50 percent in-person instruction, despite a pandemic that has already killed 1,036 people and seen infections soar in recent days. The NFL had 77 positive COVID-19 tests from 11 teams re-examined by a New Jersey lab after false positives, and all those tests came back negative. The league asked the New Jersey lab BioReference to investigate the results, and those 77 tests are being re-tested once more to make sure they were false positives. Among teams reporting false positives, the Minnesota Vikings said they had 12, the New York Jets 10 and the Chicago Bears nine. Other teams may also include the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Detroit Lions and the Cleveland Browns.  The number of positive COVID-19 tests from a specific facility that might actually be false demonstrates the precarious position the NFL is in less than three weeks from the regular-season opener. Anyone testing positive for COVID-19 — even a false positive upon a retest — is required to have two more negative tests before being cleared to return.  Thirteen people died in a stampede at a disco in Peru after a police raid to enforce the country’s lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic, officials said Sunday. The stampede happened at the Thomas disco in Lima, where about 120 people had gathered for a party on Saturday night, the Interior Ministry said. People tried to escape through the only door of the second-floor disco, trampling one another and becoming trapped in the confined space, according to authorities. After the stampede, police had to force open the door. “I feel sorry for the relatives... but also anger and indignation with the business people who organized the event,” Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra said at a public event in the south of the country. He urged judicial authorities to punish those who had broken the law. Some 23 people were arrested, and 15 of those tested positive for the new coronavirus and will be quarantined, Claudio Ramírez, a Health Ministry official, told reporters. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has not been tested for the coronavirus though he is confident he could not have been infected, his campaign said Sunday.  \"He has not been tested,\" Kate Bedingfield, deputy Biden campaign manager, said on ABC News \"This Week.\" She added that  \"moving forward should he need to be tested, he certainly would be.

The Trump administration granted authorization for the use of blood plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 as a treatment, although it has already been used experimentally on 70,000 patients. Some medical experts called Trump's announcement, revealed a day before the Republican National Convention, a \"political stunt\" that could lead to dangerous outcomes. But the president said it \"has nothing to do with politics.\" The hope is that infusions of antibody-rich plasma from recovered patients can aid the immune systems of the sick. Dr. Len Horovitz, pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, warned that plasma \"has not yet been shown to be effective in COVID-19.\" Some significant developments this weekend: 📈 Today's numbers: The U.S. has nearly 5.7 million confirmed infections and more than 176,000 deaths. Worldwide, there have been more than 806,000 deaths and 23.3 million cases, according to John Hopkins University data.📰 What we're reading: Delivering millions of vaccine doses will be a daunting task, and the federal government wants a system ready by Nov. 1. Freezer farms and UPS are part of the plan. This file will be updated throughout the day. For updates in your inbox, subscribe to the Daily Briefing. A day before Republicans convene to nominate him for a second term, President Donald Trump spent Sunday promoting a potential treatment of COVID-19 using blood plasma. Trump called a news conference to announce his administration has granted emergency use authorization for treatment using blood plasma, though more than 70,000 patients have already received it on an experimental basis. \"This is a powerful therapy,\" Trump said, describing the authorization as \"a very historic breakthrough.\" Trump and aides cast the news as a major therapeutic breakthrough, though some medical analysts said it's already happening and that Trump's demands to rush up some kind of cure for COVID-19 could lead to dangerous treatments of some patients. \"President Trump, again, puts his political gains ahead of public health,\" said Benjamin Corb, public affairs director with the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Trump is expected to use this week's Republican Party convention to emphasize his administration's search for a vaccine to stop the coronavirus that has killed more than 176,000 Americans and gutted the U.S. economy. The convention, which will be online because of the spread of COVID-19, opens Monday. – David Jackson Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has not been tested for the coronavirus though he is confident he could not have been infected, his campaign said Sunday.  \"He has not been tested,\" Kate Bedingfield, deputy Biden campaign manager, said on ABC News \"This Week.\" She added that  \"moving forward should he need to be tested, he certainly would be. But he has not been tested yet.\"  Bedingfield said Biden, 77, has followed the \"strictest protocols\" to prevent exposure to the virus and was therefore confident he had not been infected. She said everyone is around Biden \"is undergoing the appropriate testing.\"  \"He has not had the virus,\" she said.  – William Cummings Massachusetts authorities are investigating a man who gave Walmart customers a \"Covid-19 hug\" on Aug. 15 and then walked away laughing. The Springfield Police Detective Bureau said the individual took an item out of a customer's hands and hugged them. The individual then told the customer, \"Just giving you a Covid hug. You now have Covid.\" Police say the individual did this to other customers, as well. President Donald Trump's claim that the Food and Drug Administration is trying to slow testing of COVID-19 vaccines until after the November presidential election is drawing sharp rebukes.  \"The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics,\" Trump tweeted on Saturday. \"Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd.\"  The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, speaking Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" dismissed the claim and said the vaccine effort is moving at a \"historic pace.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, accused Trump of undermining public safety to help his reelection. \"The FDA must approve drugs or vaccines based on their safety and effectiveness – NOT political pressure from the White House,\" Pelosi tweeted. \"The President’s dangerous attempt to inject himself into the scientific decisions of @US_FDA jeopardizes the health & well-being of all Americans.\" The NFL said Sunday that it is investigating a rash of positive COVID-19 test results that all came from a lab in New Jersey as training camps push toward the season opener less than three weeks away. Buffalo Bills general manager Brandon Beane said he thought there were 10 or 11 teams affected by the irregularities. Many of the test results already have been determined to be false-positives. \"​Saturday's daily COVID testing returned several positives tests from each of the clubs serviced by the same laboratory in New Jersey,\" the NFL said in a statement. \"We are working with our testing partner, BioReference, to investigate these results, while the clubs work to confirm or rule out the positive tests. – Lorenzo Reyes The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped its recommendation that travelers quarantine for 14 days after visiting overseas destinations or arriving in areas with a high number of confirmed coronavirus cases. The CDC website now says arriving travelers should stay six feet from other people, wear masks and wash hands frequently – the same recommendations for people who have not traveled. The website does say travelers should follow restrictions set by state, local and territorial governments, which may require arrivals to \"to stay home for up to 14 days.\"  As COVID-19 cases mount in Mexico and the death toll soars – Mexico only trails Brazil and the United States in total pandemic fatalities – President Andrés Manuel López Obrador have increasingly pinned Mexico’s pandemic problems on its poor nutrition habits. Soda consumption has been a focus. Mexicans drink more soda per-capita than any other country – an estimated 163 liters per year. And bottlers, such as Coca-Cola, deliver its products to the remote corners of the country where potable water is scant and soda is often sold for less than water. Mexico’s beverage industry responded that Mexicans consume less than 6% of their daily calories from sugary drinks. The attacks, the industry said, “show the need to find a public enemy to hold responsible for the health crisis.\" – David Agren Among factors contributing to poorer health and more susceptibility to COVID-19 deaths among Black and Hispanic Americans is a significant difference with majority white populations in access to parks for outdoor recreation opportunities, according to a new study. The report by the nonprofit land-access advocacy group Trust for Public Land finds that parks serving primarily non-white populations nationwide are half the size of parks serving majority white populations, and are five times more crowded. Experts say the lack of access to parks means people living in dense, urban areas have a harder time getting as much physical exercise as recommended and are missing out on equally important mental health wellness opportunities. Black and Hispanic Americans also tend to have higher rates of diabetes, obesity and heart disease because they are less likely to go to the doctor or have health insurance, and their overall health is poorer due to systemic poverty. — Trevor Hughes Georgia on Saturday became the 10th state in the nation to report that it has surpassed 5,000 deaths caused by COVID-19. The Georgia Department of Public Health said there have been at least 5,092 deaths in the state caused by the coronavirus and more than 252,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who was among the first governors to ease earlier restrictions this spring, highlighted the downward trends this past week. He has used social media to remind residents to wear a mask, maintain social distancing and follow guidance from the health department. Several dozen aging U.S. veterans will gather on a battleship in Pearl Harbor next month to mark the 75th anniversary of Japan's surrender, even if it means the vulnerable group may be risking their lives again amid the coronavirus pandemic. The 75th anniversary was meant to be a blockbuster event, and the veterans have been looking forward to it for years. There were to be thousands of people watching in Hawaii as parades marched through Waikiki, vintage planes flying overhead, and gala dinners to honor the veterans. Now, most in-person celebrations have been canceled over fears the virus could infect the veterans, who range from 90 to 101. But about 200 people, mostly veterans, their families and government officials, will still commemorate the milestone on the USS Missouri, which hosted the surrender on Sept. 2, 1945, in Tokyo Bay. A federal appeals court granted New York's attempts to block weddings from having more than 50 people, allowing the court fight to continue. The ruling thwarted efforts by at least one couple to have a large wedding this weekend and leaves in doubt any other weddings that exceed more than 50 attendees. One couple planned on being married Saturday in Erie County with 175 people expected to attend, the court papers said. The couple's attorney, Anthony Rupp, told the Times Union the wedding will be moved to a later date. \"We had won every stage of this thing, but the judge in the 2nd Circuit just cavalierly postponed it until Tuesday,\" Rupp said. \"So we're very unhappy about this decision.\" – Joseph Spector, New York State Team On Facebook: There's still a lot unknown about the coronavirus.

It's hard to know how COVID-19 will mix with flu season: Will mask wearing and social distancing contain flu transmission as it's meant to do with SARS-CoV-2? Or will both viruses ransack the nation as some schools reopen for in-person learning?  \"This fall, nothing can be more important than to try to increase the American public's decision to embrace the flu vaccine with confidence,\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told the editor of JAMA on Thursday. \"This is a critical year for us to try to take flu as much off the table as we can.\" Here's what doctors say you should know about the flu vaccine as we approach this year's season:  The CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine every year. State officials announced Wednesday the flu vaccine is required for all Massachusetts students enrolled in child care, preschool, K-12 and post-secondary institutions. “It is more important now than ever to get a flu vaccine because flu symptoms are very similar to those of COVID-19, and preventing the flu will save lives and preserve health care resources,” said Dr. Lawrence Madoff, medical director of the Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Dr. Susan Rehm, vice chair at the Cleveland Clinic’s Department of Infectious Diseases, said patients should get the influenza vaccine as soon as possible. CVS stores have the flu vaccine in stock, and it became available Monday at Walgreens. “I plan to get my flu shot as soon as the vaccines are available,” Rehm said. “My understanding is that they should be available in late August, early September nationwide.” Other doctors recommend that patients get their flu shot in late September or early October, so protection can last throughout the flu season, which typically ends around March or April. The vaccine lasts about sixmonths. The CDC recommends people get a flu vaccine no later than the end of October – because it takes a few weeks for the vaccine to become fully protective – but encourages people to get vaccinated later rather than not at all. Healthy people can get their flu vaccine as soon as it’s available, but experts recommend older people and those who are immunocompromised wait until mid-fall to get their shots, so they last throughout the flu season. People over 65 should get Fluzone High-Dose, or FLUAD, because it provides better protection against flu viruses. Fluzone High-Dose contains four times the antigen that's in a standard dose, effectively making it a stronger version of the regular flu shot. FLUAD pairs the regular vaccine with an adjuvant, an immune stimulant, to cause the immune system to have a higher response to the vaccine.  Research indicates that such high-dose flu vaccines have improved a patient's protection against the flu. A peer-reviewed study published in The New England Journal of Medicine and sponsored by Sanofi, the company behind Fluzone High-Dose, found the high-dose vaccine is about 24% more effective than the standard shot in preventing the flu. An observational study in 2013 found FLUAD is 51% effective in preventing flu-related hospitalizations for patients 65 and older. There are no studies that do a comparative analysis between the two vaccines. According to the CDC, hundreds of millions of Americans have safely received flu vaccine over the past 50 years. Common side effects for the vaccine include soreness at the injection spot, headache, fever, nausea and muscle aches. Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, emphasized that these symptoms are not the flu because the vaccine cannot cause influenza. “That’s just your body working on the vaccine and your immune response responding to the vaccine,” he said. “That’s a small price to pay to keep you out of the emergency room. Believe me.” Some studies have found a small association of the flu vaccine with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), but Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said there’s a one in a million chance of that happening. Not only is the flu vaccine safe, but the pharmacies, doctors offices and hospitals administering it are also safe. Horovitz and Schaffner said hospitals take all the necessary precautions to make sure patients are protected against COVID-19. Some hospitals send staff out to patients’ cars for inoculation while others allow them to bypass the waiting room. Doctors offices require masks and social distancing, and they are routinely disinfected. “Call your health care provider to make sure you can get in and out quickly,” Schaffner advised. “It’s safe to get the flu vaccine and very important.” Experts speculate any vaccine could hypothetically provide some protection against a virus, but there’s little data that suggests the flu vaccine can protect against the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. “We don’t want to confuse people of that … because there’s simply no data,” Schaffner said. “Flu vaccine prevents flu; we’re working on a coronavirus vaccine. They’re separate.” A study in 2018 found that the flu vaccine reduces the risk of being admitted to an ICU with flu by 82%, according to the CDC. \"People perhaps forget that influenza is something that we see every year,\" Rehm said. \"Tens of thousands of people die of influenza ever year, including people who are very healthy, and hundreds of thousands of people are hospitalized every year.\" Doctors said it will be even more hectic this year because some flu and COVID-19 symptoms overlap, delaying diagnosis and possibly care. “Even before COVID, what we say about the flu is that it’s predictably unpredictable,” Rehm said. “There are some years that it’s a light year and some years that it’s horrible.” Flu experts said they sometimes look at Australia’s flu season to get a sense of the strain and how it spreads, because winter in the Southern Hemisphere started a few months ago.  According to the country’s Department of Health surveillance report, influenza has virtually disappeared: only 85 cases in the last two weeks of June, compared with more than 20,000 confirmed cases that time last year. “Australia has had a modest season, but they were very good at implementing COVID containment measures, and of course, we’re not,” Schaffner said. “So we’re anticipating that we’re going to have a flu season that’s substantial.” The CDC said two types of vaccines are available for the 2020-2021 season: the trivalent and quadrivalent. Trivalents contain two flu A strains and one flu B strain and are available only as high-dose vaccines. Quadrivalents contain those three strains plus an additional flu B strain, and they can be high- or standard-dose vaccines.  Though some doctors may have both vaccines, others may have only one, depending on their supply chain. Natasha Bhuyan, a practicing family physician in Phoenix, said people should get whatever vaccine is available. \"Vaccines are a selfless act. They’re protecting yourself and your friends through herd immunity,\" she said. \"Any vaccine that you can get access to, you can get.\" Horovitz said vaccine production and distribution have been on schedule, despite international focus on coronavirus vaccine development. He has received his shipment to the hospital and plans to administer the vaccine with four strains closer to the start of the season. “I don’t think anything suffered because something else was being developed,” he said. “(The flu vaccine) has been pretty well established for the last 20 to 30 years.” Producers boosted supplies of the flu vaccine to meet what they expect will be higher demand. Vaccine maker Sanofi announced Monday that it will produce 15% more vaccine than in a normal year. Redfield told JAMA the CDC arranged for an additional 9.3 million doses of low-cost flu vaccine for uninsured adults, up from 500,000. The agency expanded  plans to reach out to minority communities. After the swine flu pandemic in 2009, several studies showed the nasal spray flu vaccine was less effective against H1N1 viruses, leading the CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to advise against it. Since the 2017-2018 season, the advisory committee and the CDC voted to resume the recommendation for its use after the manufacturer used new H1N1 vaccine viruses in production. Though agencies and advisory committees don’t recommend one vaccine over the other, some pediatricians argue the nasal spray is easier to administer to children than a shot. Other doctors prefer the flu shot because some of the nasal spray side effects mimic respiratory symptoms, including wheezing, coughing and a runny nose, according to the CDC. Horovitz said anything that presents cold symptoms should probably be avoided, especially among children who are vectors of respiratory diseases. “Giving them something that gives them cold (symptoms) for two or three days may expel more virus if they’re asymptomatic with COVID,” he said.

Fresno, California-based fruit distributor Prima Wawona said Saturday that it had issued a recall for all of its bulk and loose peaches distributed and sold from June 1 through August 3. It also recalled its bagged Wawona and Wawona Organic brand peaches distributed and sold from June 1 through August 19.  The company warned that the products \"could possibly be contaminated with Salmonella,\" which can cause fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and, in vulnerable people, can be fatal. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had identified 68 cases in nine states as of Wednesday in an investigation that is continuing. The Food and Drug Administration on Saturday warned Americans not to eat, sell or serve peaches sold by Prima Wawona until further notice. Consumers who have peaches at home and can't remember when they bought them or which brand they are should discard them, the FDA said. When will extra unemployment start?:Don't expect $300 boost anytime soon What's that direct deposit for?:IRS distributes tax refund interest checks to taxpayers who filed 2019 returns on time The agency also advised anyone who had the peaches to use \"extra vigilance in cleaning and sanitizing any surfaces and containers that may have come in contact with the produce to reduce the risk of cross-contamination. This includes cutting boards, slicers, countertops, refrigerators, and storage bins.\" Retailers that sold the peaches include Walmart, Target, Aldi, Wegmans, Food 4 Less, Foods Co., Smiths, Ralphs, Fry's, City Market, King Soopers and Jay-C. They were sold under the following brand names and product codes: Wawona Peaches (033383322001), Wawona Organic Peaches (849315000400), Prima Peaches (766342325903), Organic Marketside Peaches (849315000400), Kroger Peaches (011110181749) and Wegmans Peaches (077890490488). “We’re conducting this voluntary recall in cooperation with the FDA out of consideration for the wellbeing and safety of our customers and consumers,” said George Nikolich, vice president of technical operations for Prima Wawona, in a statement. “We continue to be committed to serving consumers with high quality fruit.” According to the CDC, most people infected with salmonella develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps six hours to six days after being exposed to the bacteria. The illness usually lasts four to seven days and most people recover without treatment. In some people, the illness may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other places in the body. Children younger than 5 years, adults 65 years and older, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to have a severe illness, the CDC says. Kelly Tyko contributed to this report.

She understands why they're hesitant. Black Americans have a long history of being treated poorly by the medical establishment; many faced discrimination in medical care themselves. Still, if they don't participate in the trials meant to establish vaccine safety and effectiveness, they'll never know whether the vaccines will work for them.  \"The risks for not being involved are so great,\" said Wilkerson, a founding member of Boston's Black COVID-19 Coalition. About 25% of the city's population is Black, yet Blacks have made up more than 35% of those infected and killed by COVID-19.  Nationally, the figures are even worse. Just over 80 Black Americans have died of COVID-19 out of every 100,000, compared with 46 Latino Americans and 36 white Americans, according to the American Public Media Research Lab. The first two large-scale vaccine trials began nationwide in late July, and at least three more will start before early fall. Each one will need 30,000 volunteers, half of whom will get an active vaccine and half a placebo.   Federal officials – including the heads of the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – have called for these trials to include a large number of people of color.  \"We must make sure there is appropriate diversity in the clinical trials,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in an recent interview with the editor of the scientific journal JAMA. Even if everyone's immune system reacts the same way to the virus, differences in care and underlying health may mean people of color respond differently to infection, Hahn said: \"We need to make sure those folks are in these trials so that we understand what the immunological effects are, but also the clinical effects.\" In addition to racial and ethnic diversity, most of the trials also are looking for people over 65. Older immune systems don't work as well as they used to, and older people have been disproportionately sickened and killed by the virus that causes COVID-19. Early trials haven't been diverse. In the two small clinical trials that have published their results, one in The New England Journal of Medicine, one in The Lancet, only eight of 1,100 participants were Black. In both studies, participant age averaged in the mid-30s. It's not for lack of enthusiasm in the trials. More than 300,000 people have already expressed interest in volunteering to participate. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, which is managing a registry of volunteers, is not breaking them down by demographic group. But Hahn said 19% of those who had volunteered so far were Black and nearly the same percentage were Latino.  And although 300,000 sounds like a lot of volunteers, it's not nearly enough, said Claire Hudson, a spokesperson for the center. \"It’s important to note that we need millions of interested volunteers to join the online registry,\" coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org, she said via email. Not all the people who express interest in volunteering will make it into one of the trials, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, explained at a teleconference announcing the start of the first trial. Some volunteers might not live near testing sites, for instance.  \"The more the better,\" Collins said of volunteers. \"This is going to be a big American opportunity for people to come on board as our partners to try to take part in what has been a historic effort to bring to an end the worst pandemic our world has seen in over 100 years.\" Dr. Barbara Pahud has a plan: If not enough people of color will come to major medical centers to volunteer for clinical trials, she'll bring the clinical trials to them. As a medical student in Mexico, Pahud was given a cooler of shots to deliver to the community. Now, she's has outfitted a van that she plans to park – perhaps at a health center or church – to take vaccine trials where Americans of color spend their time. Pahud, research director of pediatric infectious diseases at Children’s Mercy Kansas City, said she's also making an effort to hire people who speak Spanish, and to have all printed material available in two languages. \"The usual stuff that should always be done is actually being done this time, which is fantastic,\" she said.  Researchers and community members will both need to take a risk. \"If we really want to do research that reflects the community that we live in, that is being impacted by this disease, we (researchers) need to change our mindset,\" Pahud said. On the flip side, \"communities need to understand that if they want to benefit from the vaccine, they need to let their people volunteer, or we won't be able to know if the vaccine works in their population.\" Others are making similar efforts. At the University of Colorado, Thomas Campbell said his medical practice has used its electronic medical records to identify and reach out to everyone at high risk for COVID-19. \"I've already had over 100 people email me personally and said 'sign me up,'\" said Campbell, also an infectious disease physician at UCHealth. Pfizer, which has launched its own 30,000-person trial, is locating its trials in diverse communities, including some with large Hispanic and Black populations, spokesperson Sharon Castillo said. \"We're making sure that the demographics of our trial population reflects the demographics of the states and communities that have been most impacted,\" she said. Pfizer also is working with partners, such as grassroots organizations and local and Spanish media, to raise awareness and encourage participation. And the company is reducing barriers to participation, Castillo said, by printing materials in five languages.  \"We're learning a lot on how to go above and beyond to make sure minorities are represented,\" she said, promising that Pfizer would continue this approach in all its clinical trials going forward. But good intentions may not be enough. Wilkerson said a recent meeting with officials at Brigham and Women's Hospital did not end where she wanted it to. The hospital has reached out to Black leaders, including Wilkerson, for help in encouraging minority participation in these trials. Hospital officials said that meeting and others with local people of color have gone well. \"We are committed to continuing an engaging and substantive discussion on how we can work in partnership, both for the local implementation of this trial and in future clinical research more broadly,\" said Allison Moriarty, Brigham's vice president of research administration and compliance.  But Wilkerson said a few listening sessions and dropping flyers at local communities centers won't be enough to redress decades of mistrust, or to get Black Bostonians to participate. \"We have an opportunity to reset how (hospitals) relate to Black and brown people,\" she said, adding that her group plans to seize that opportunity: \"We intend to get their attention.\" Contact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com Health and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

A federal appeals court Friday granted New York's attempts to block weddings from having more than 50 people, allowing the court fight to continue. The ruling thwarted efforts by at least one couple to have a large wedding this weekend and leaves in doubt any other weddings that exceed more than 50 attendees. One couple planned on being married Saturday in Erie County with 175 people expected to attend, the court papers said. The couple's attorney, Anthony Rupp, told the Times Union the wedding will be moved to a later date. \"We had won every stage of this thing, but the judge in the 2nd Circuit just cavalierly postponed it until Tuesday,\" Rupp said. \"So we're very unhappy about this decision.\" — Joseph Spector, New York State Team Fewer than 25 coronavirus cases have been connected to the 10-day Sturgis motorcycle rally this month, South Dakota epidemiologist Josh Clayton said. Those are cases where the person attended the rally within 14 days of the onset of their symptoms. He cautioned that it doesn't mean the rally is the only place where they may have been exposed to it.  South Dakota health officials say anyone who visited three bars in Sturgis on Aug. 15 should monitor for symptoms of the coronavirus. A person who tested positive for COVID-19 visited The Knuckle Saloon, the Broken Spoke and One Eyed Jack's, the officials said Friday.  This confirmed case comes one day after state health officials announced potential COVID-19 exposure at a local tattoo parlor, another bar and a grill. Meanwhile, 15 Minnesotans contracted the coronavirus after exposure during the 10-day rally, the Associated Press reports.  — Megan Raposa, Sioux Falls Argue Leader South Korea, which in spring had celebrated hard-won gains against the coronavirus, is again banning large gatherings, closing beaches, shutting nightspots and churches, and removing fans from professional sports in strict new measures announced Saturday as it battles the spread of the disease. Health Minister Park Neung-hoo announced the steps shortly after the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 332 new cases – the ninth straight day of triple-digit increases. The national caseload is now at 17,002, including 309 deaths. While most of the new cases came from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, which has been at the center of the viral surge in recent weeks, infections were also reported in almost every major city and town, raising concerns that transmissions are slipping out of control. The government had already imposed elevated social distancing measures in Seoul this week after resisting them for months out of economic concerns. “We are now in a very dangerous situation that could trigger a massive nationwide spread of COVID-19,” Park said.  — The Associated Press To stop the spread of the coronavirus, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said he is prepared to shut the country down as president if that were recommended by scientists. “I would shut it down. I would listen to the scientists,” the former vice president told ABC News' David Muir on Friday in an interview set to air Sunday. Biden’s comments are the strongest he has proposed if he becomes president to squash the spread of COVID-19 – which has infected over 5.6 million and killed more than 175,000 people in the U.S. as of Saturday morning, according to Johns Hopkins University.  He continued that \"in order to keep the country running and moving and the economy growing, and people employed, you have to fix the virus, you have to deal with the virus.” — Savannah Behrmann A 6-year-old Florida girl has become the state's youngest victim of the coronavirus pandemic. The Hillsborough county child was among 117 new deaths reported Friday by the Florida Department of Health. Her death comes as Gov. Ron DeSantis is considering lifting restrictions that would allow Palm Beach County school children to return to school. Since the pandemic began in March, seven other children under the age of 18 have succumbed to the highly contagious respiratory disease. The deaths include one child in Broward County and two in Miami-Dade County. While DeSantis has pushed for the reopening of schools, saying children are less likely to become seriously ill or spread the coronavirus to others, statewide 47,762 children have been infected since March 1. Of those, 3,069 were in Palm Beach County, according to state reports. — Jane Musgrave, The Palm Beach Post At Ohio State, more than 65% of students live outside university housing, which has been limited to 20 students under one roof. But will crowding and parties spoil careful social distancing plans on campus? The university is asking students not to gather in groups of more than 10, even off campus. But by Friday evening, the university was already in the process of opening \"dozens\" of student disciplinary cases stemming from student parties that officials said failed to follow social distancing rules. “We have one shot at this – responding to what so many of you asked for: an on-campus semester at Ohio State,” warned Vice President for Student Life Melissa S. Shivers. Read more here.  – Jennifer Smola, The Columbus Dispatch Among factors contributing to poorer health and more susceptibility to COVID-19 deaths among Black and Hispanic Americans is a significant difference with majority white populations in access to parks for outdoor recreation opportunities, according to a new study. The report by the nonprofit land-access advocacy group Trust for Public Land finds that parks serving primarily nonwhite populations nationwide are half the size of parks serving majority white populations, and are five times more crowded. Experts say the lack of access to parks means people living in dense, urban areas have a harder time getting as much physical exercise as recommended and are missing out on equally important mental health wellness opportunities. Black and Hispanic Americans also tend to have higher rates of diabetes, obesity and heart disease because they are less likely to go to the doctor or have health insurance, and their overall health is poorer due to systemic poverty. — Trevor Hughes Operation Warp Speed — the White House-led partnership for COVID-19 answers — is pushing its partners to be ready to begin distributing the coronavirus vaccine by Nov. 1.  There has been speculation President Donald Trump might launch an \"October Surprise,\" counting on the release of a coronavirus vaccine to buoy his chances at the ballot box on Nov. 3. The Food and Drug Administration and other top government scientists have said only science and data will be taken into account when deciding if a vaccine is accepted.  — Elizabeth Weise California pastor Rob McCoy and the church he leads were held in contempt of court Friday for failing to obey a restraining order that prohibits indoor worship services in an attempt to curb COVID-19. Ventura County Superior Court Judge Vincent O'Neill Jr. issued the ruling against McCoy and the Godspeak Calvary Chapel in Newbury Park, northwest of Los Angeles, after a two-hour hearing in Ventura. He fined the chapel $3,000, but did not impose any fines on McCoy. That was half the $6,000 Ventura County officials had recommended against the church, based on a fine of $1,000 for each of the six services held indoors over the past two Sundays. County officials had not recommended a fine against McCoy either. — Kathleen Wilson, Ventura County Star The U.S. turned a dark corner in the battle against the coronavirus as the death count passed the 175,000 mark Friday, according to Johns Hopkins University. The dead were among 5.6 million cases in the U.S. so far, about a quarter of the world's 22.9 million cases. The last milestone was 150,000 at the end of July and before that, 100,000 at the end of May.  The U.S. ranks first among nations in deaths. It is followed by Brazil, Mexico, India and United Kingdom and Italy. The former Navy SEAL who claims he shot Osama bin Laden in 2011 is now back in the news for another reason: being banned from flying Delta Air Lines. Delta confirmed to USA TODAY on Friday that it banned Robert O'Neill from future flights after he tweeted a photo of himself going maskless on a flight, though he said he had it in his lap. \"I just got banned from @Delta for posting a picture. Wow,\" O'Neill tweeted. He becomes part of a group of about 130 people who have been banished for the same reason. – Jayme Deerwester One in five nursing homes in the United States had severe shortages of personal protective equipment this summer, a new study says, which also found that many facilities in the hardest hit areas struggled to retain staff. The analysis of federal data published in the journal Health Affairs also found there was no improvement from May to July in the PPE shortages or staffing concerns. COVID-19 cases in the South, West and Midwest surged during that time period. Terry Fulmer, president of the John A. Hartford Foundation, a nonprofit that works to improve care for older adults, called the study's findings \"a massive red flag.\" “We have had no coherent federal response,” Fulmer said. The findings come despite pledges from the Trump administration to help. “The federal government should really own this issue,” said study author David Grabowski.

The date is the first concrete goal set for companies working with Operation Warp Speed to deliver vaccines to doctors and hospitals, said Wes Wheeler of the delivery giant United Parcel Service. Wheeler said UPS and other partners will conduct test delivery runs in September. “We’ll be ready. We have to be ready,\" he said. \"The world is watching. We can’t fail.\" Operation Warp Speed includes federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture. The initiative aims to expedite the rapid production of COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccines. Its goal is to produce and deliver 300 million doses of vaccine by January. UPS is a consultant to Operation Warp Speed, Wheeler said. UPS expects to be involved with the government and private drug manufacturers in the logistics of vaccine distribution and storage. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he expects a vaccine to be released “very soon.” There has been speculation he might launch an \"October surprise,\" counting on the release of a coronavirus vaccine to buoy his chances at the ballot box Nov. 3. The FDA and other top government scientists have said only science and data will be taken into account when deciding whether a vaccine is accepted. Thursday, Peter Marks,  director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told Reuters he has faced no political pressure to release a vaccine without sufficient data on safety and effectiveness and he would resign if that happened. The FDA said it might consider releasing at least the first vaccine under what's known as an Emergency Use Authorization rather than the full licensing process, if it has sufficient data on safety and efficacy.  \"We have to balance the need to see a biologics license application ... (which has) thousands of pages with a lot of different analyses, many of which will not be directly relevant for a decision of whether or not to make the vaccine available,\" Marks told journalists attending National Press Foundation training Aug. 13. No one can say with certainty when the FDA will approve a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine because it’s not known when the results of large clinical trials will be available or whether those results will meet the agency's requirements for safety and effectiveness, said Dr. Kelly Moore, associate director of immunization education and the Immunization Action Coalition. “Nonetheless, those preparing to distribute a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine are aiming to be ready to begin distribution as soon as a vaccine is approved,” said Moore, a professor of health policy at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. The logistics are daunting. The U.S. government is investing in at least seven potential vaccines. At least one of themneeds to be stored and transported at -80 degrees Celsius or -112 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature at which antifreeze freezes and rubber shatters. Three others have to be stored at -20 degrees Celsius or -4 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature ice cream is shipped at. The candidate vaccines are produced and stored at manufacturing sites across the country. If they prove safe and effective, and are approved by the FDA, they will be released for use. Any candidate vaccines that don’t will be destroyed. Delivery of the vaccine to sites where it can be administered will happen in two waves, an early one, when supplies are limited and the military will be involved in logistics, and a later one, when the vaccine is plentiful and can be distributed through regular vaccination channels. “That plan is that in phase 1, we will have 10 million doses distributed in November and 20 million doses in December,” said Wheeler, president of UPS Healthcare. Because the initial doses will be in limited supply, the focus is expected to be on getting high-priority recipients – probably health workers – fully vaccinated first, Moore said. “I get the sense the Centers for Disease Control, the Department of Defense and the states will target a limited number of locations where they can easily reach people determined to be top priority,” she said. Once more vaccine becomes available, probably within several months, the second wave of distribution would go through the routine vaccine distribution program, probably using the national Vaccines for Children program as a backbone, she said. That’s when vaccinations would probably become available at major pharmaceutical chains such as Walgreens and CVS. Both companies plan for that, they told USA TODAY. The logistical situation is remarkably complex because there are multiple items involved. Experts presume more than one vaccine may be ready early on, meaning there could be one, two or as many as seven different vaccines administered nationally at the same time, each with a different temperature storage requirement. Some vaccines might work better for one group and others for another. That’s an enormous transportation complication, Wheeler said. “They’re going to try to match effect with patient population,\" he said. \"So if one of the vaccines looks as if it will work best with young, healthy people, then you divert to that population; if another works better with the elderly, then it would go to that population specifically.” Operation Warp Speed wants the doses shipped with a matching vaccination kit containing personal protective equipment for the person giving the shot and leaflets about that particular vaccine, Wheeler said. “In 30 years in the drug business, I’ve never seen anything like this. The logistics are amazing,” he said. UPS is involved in distributing doses of several of the candidate vaccines being tested in clinical trials, in which 30,000 volunteers are given either a candidate vaccine or a placebo shot. “There is not one single vial to spare, not one. We have 24/7 GPS tracking on every shipment,” he said. As it gears up for the work, UPS is building a “freezer farm” at its Louisville, Kentucky, air operations headquarters, as well as a COVID-19-specific operations center. The freezer farm building will be filled with hundreds of ultra-low temperature freezers, each about the size of a large home refrigerator, that can hold materials as low as -85 degrees Celsius. “About half the freezers are already in place, and they’re being validated now,” Wheeler said. The company has similar freezer farms in the Netherlands at its international air transit hub. Vaccine that must be kept at -80 degrees Celsius will be transported in boxes topped off with dry ice, which can be replenished as it boils away, Wheeler said. Air transportation requires another level of planning at these temperatures because there are limits on the amount of dry ice that can be loaded onto planes under FAA regulations. As it sublimates to gaseous carbon dioxide, there is a danger the oxygen content of the air would fall too low, incapacitating the crew. Keeping vaccines at their proper temperature is crucial to keeping them effective, said Jaap Venema,  chief science officer for U.S. Pharmacopeia, a public standard-setting organization for drugs. As much of 25% of vaccine globally is lost because of cold chain issues. As the world works to create enough coronavirus vaccine for everyone, such loses are unimaginable, he said. “That’s keeping me up at night,” he said. Vaccine developer Pfizer said it has detailed logistical plans and tools to support transportation of its candidate vaccine, which must be kept frozen at -80 degrees Celsius. “We have specially designed, temperature-controlled containers that would allow the maintenance of storage conditions up to 10 days,” said Pfizer’s director of media relations, Steve Danehy. “We are confident of our capability to deliver and store doses to the destinations governments designate, according to requirements at -80.\" Contributing: Karen Weintraub Health and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

South Dakota Department of Public Safety Director Paul Niedringhaus sent a letter to people who may have been affected by the June 19 breach, the Rapid City Journal reported Friday. The letter, dated Monday, says the state’s fusion center used Netsential.com’s services to build a secure online portal this spring to help first responders identify people who had tested positive for the coronavirus so they could take precautions while responding to emergency calls. The South Dakota letter said police in the state weren’t given names but could call a dispatcher to verify positive cases. Houston-based Netsentials added labels to the files that might allow a third-party to identify patients, the letter said, and the breach could have compromised people’s names, addresses and virus status. “This information may continue to be available on various internet sites that link to files from the Netsential breach,” the letter said.  --Associated Press You can step up to the blackjack table in Las Vegas, but you can't order a drink anytime soon. It'll be at least two weeks before the nation's gambling capital allows bars to reopen, Nevada’s COVID-19 task force decided Thursday. The rule applies to the Las Vegas Strip, downtown and rest of Clark County. The task force also imposed limits on how many people can eat together in restaurants. The Las Vegas area surpassed 1,000 total COVID-19 deaths for the first time as Nevada reported 38 more fatalities from the virus on Thursday — the third straight day that COVID deaths saw a large spike in the state’s daily numbers. \"This is an extremely important decision – and one that I think we need to take very cautiously,\" said task force Chairman Caleb Cage, noting the economic consequences to Las Vegas and Nevada. Casinos remain open. The task force wants to work with officials to enhance plans to increase compliance and enforcement to stem the spread of COVID-19, Cage said.  --Ed Komenda, Reno Gazette Journal For those who have tuned in to Gov. Doug Ducey’s briefings over the past month, the message he delivered Thursday was a familiar one. So was the warning.  Arizona's COVID-19 containment measures are working, but it's too soon to take a \"victory lap,\" Gov. Doug Ducey said Friday. His message to Arizonans: Don't let your guard down. Daily case counts, from new infections to hospitalization rates, are moving in the right direction. But it’s too soon for Arizonans to let their guard down and take a “victory lap,\" he said. Others are noting Arizona's progress. Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, cited the Grand Canyon State for its efforts to improve in an interview Thursday. “Returning our kids to the classroom, reuniting with our loved ones —  all of these depend on continued responsible behavior,” Ducey said, standing alongside state Department of Health Services Director Dr. Cara Christ. “I urge everyone to stay the course.” --Maria Polletta, Arizona Republic New York state's COVID-19 hospitalizations dropped to 490, settling below 500 for the first time since March 16, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo reported Friday. The number of intensive-care patients dealing with COVID-19 fell to 119, the lowest since March 15. It's a start contrast from a few months ago when New York led the nation in both the number of coronavirus cases and deaths.  Helping to keep hospitalizations low: a record high number of tests, with 98,880 results reported to New York state Thursday, Cuomo said. Only 0.72% of those tests have been showing up positive, staying below 1% for the 14th straight day. \"Part of the reason we were able to tame the beast in New York is because of our aggressive testing strategy,\" Cuomo said in a statement. \"This is proof positive that when you have the virus under control, more testing does not equal more positives.\"  CDC officials say they are encouraged by a new study that found relatively small retransmission rates of the coronavirus in child care facilities.  Child care centers in Rhode Island saw secondary transmission as having possibly occurred in only four of 666 programs that had been allowed to reopen, all in a two-week period at the end of July, the study found. Having social distancing and safety measures, such as limited the number of children in any program, CDC officials point to the study as a sign that more child care facilities and schools can reopen. It has to happen \"school by school, community by community,\" said Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC's director. And \"in order for schools to reopen, we have to have the confidence of teachers.\"  The child care centers were limited to 12 kids initially by the state, then were allowed to handle up to 20. Adults had to wear masks and both adults and children were screened daily for symptoms. The facilities also underwent enhanced cleaning and disinfection.  The former Navy SEAL who claims he shot Osama bin Laden in 2011 is now back in the news for another reason: being banned from flying Delta Air Lines.

No longer able to depend on bustling city centers, these small businesses on wheels are venturing out to where people are working and spending most of their time – home.  As food trucks hunt for customers that used to flock to them, they’re finding a captive audience thrilled to skip cooking dinner, sample new kinds of cuisines and mingle with neighbors on what feels like a night out while safely staying close to home. “This is festival season, fun season. All the stuff we typically do as humans, we can’t do anymore,” said Matt Geller, president of the National Food Truck Association. “Walking out to a food truck is a taste of normalcy, and it feels really good.” B.J. Lofback decided to pivot his Nashville-area food truck and restaurant away from labor-intensive Korean food and rebranded as Pinchy’s Lobster Co. selling lobster rolls. Without his usual downtown Nashville lunchtimes and music events, he and other truckers began reaching out to homeowners associations in large subdivisions. “I’m hoping that even if a vaccine dropped tomorrow and herd immunity was accomplished tomorrow, I hope neighborhoods still have us out,” Lofback said. – Associated Press Indicative of the financial strain that hospitals are seeing around the country, Florida hospitals say they have collectively lost nearly $4 billion in the past four months because of the coronavirus. Even with financial aid from the government, hospitals around the state said they are hemorrhaging money due to increased staffing costs, testing and other protective equipment, along with lost revenue from patients delaying care or canceling elective surgeries. “The COVID-19 pandemic has financially shocked our health care system,” Florida Hospital Association’s Interim President Crystal Stickle said in a statement Friday. The group represents over 200 hospitals, and estimated projected losses through August at $7.4 billion. The state health department reported Friday 4,684 new confirmed cases and 119 new deaths from the virus, though hospitalizations due to COVID-19 have also been declining over the past month.  – Associated Press The head of the U.S. Postal Service testified before the Senate on Friday as the agency faces increased scrutiny from lawmakers due to operational changes and service cuts they say could hinder the agency's ability to handle an expected surge of mail-in ballots in the November elections. President Donald Trump's Postmaster General Louis DeJoy acknowledged delays in mail delivery Friday but defended the changes. \"We all feel bad about the dip in our service,\" he told Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who had asked about delays in deliveries of prescriptions to veterans.  Despite criticism, DeJoy said changes at the agency were made to help restore the agency's financial health and called it the Postal Service's \"sacred duty\" to deliver election mail this November.  Breaking with Trump, who has expressed opposition to voting by mail, DeJoy said he had voted by mail himself \"for a number of years\" and supported the practice.  – Nicholas Wu Empty mailboxes, missed rent:US Postal Service's struggles have real-world impacts Annie Gaughan was only on her second day at the University of Iowa's campus when she tested positive for COVID-19 and was forced to relocate to Currier Hall, the campus' quarantine dorm. While the university claims to have spent months sanitizing academic buildings and residence halls, Gaughan said that care seemed to have been missing from the room she was given. She noticed rust on the sink and dust on the mattress. The next morning, she awoke to ants in her blankets. While she wanted to go home, her parents, she said, are in a CDC-recognized high-risk category. So she booked a hotel room in Naperville, Illinois, traveling by bus, where she's been for the past week. \"They are telling students and parents they are prepared for COVID, but they lied. They are not,\" Gaughan wrote. \"I really hope that the university transitions to online at this point because they are not prepared for students who test positive for COVID.\" – Zachary Oren Smith, Iowa City Press-Citizen Pfizer and BioNTech saw strong results in an early-stage trial for a candidate COVID-19 vaccine, the companies announced late Thursday. The companies had launched clinical trials with two candidate vaccines, releasing data on the other one earlier this month. Both appeared to be safe in the small number of healthy people who received the shots. The new data, on a compound called BNT162b2, showed this candidate to be better than the other at triggering an immune response. In adults under 55, BNT162b2 produced nearly four times the amount of neutralizing antibodies as a natural infection. In older adults, who are more vulnerable to a serious COVID-19 infection and have weaker immune systems, the candidate vaccine produced 1.6 times as many antibodies. Such high levels of antibodies suggest the vaccine will be effective at preventing disease or at least reducing the seriousness of infection.  Last month, the companies launched a 30,000-person trial to test BNT162b2’s effectiveness, as well as safety in a larger, more diverse group. They have so far enrolled 11,000 volunteers in the trial, according to a company press release, and expect to have results as soon as October. – Karen Weintraub Hawaii Gov. David Ige announced earlier this week that the state won't reopen to tourism until at least October, which means its 14-day mandatory quarantine for both out-of-state and inter-island travelers (in Kauai, Hawaii, Maui and Kalawao counties) remains intact. But details have since emerged about a \"resort bubble concept\" for inter-island travelers. The state calls the program an \"enhanced movement quarantine\" that each county can develop to give residents and visitors the ability to travel between islands without a 14-day quarantine. Officials had been reviewing an idea that would allow tourists to roam freely on resorts while their movements are tracked via a wearable monitor to ensure they stay inside the boundaries of the facilities. The so-called “resort bubble” concept would keep the tourists within a “geofence” that tracks their movements, West Hawaii Today reported. – David Oliver One in five nursing homes in the United States had severe shortages of personal protective equipment this summer, a new study says, which also found that many facilities in the hardest hit areas struggled to retain staff. The analysis of federal data published in the journal Health Affairs also found there was no improvement from May to July in the PPE shortages or staffing concerns. COVID-19 cases in the South, West and Midwest surged during that time period. Terry Fulmer, president of the John A. Hartford Foundation, a nonprofit that works to improve care for older adults, called the study's findings \"a massive red flag.\" “We have had no coherent federal response,” Fulmer said. The findings come despite pledges from the Trump administration to help. “The federal government should really own this issue,” said study author David Grabowski. The 324 new cases of the coronavirus that South Korea reported Friday is the highest daily case count the country has seen since March. New COVID-19 cases in South Korea are surging around the Seoul metropolitan region, but the new cases Friday included positive tests in practically all of the country's major cities. The government reimposed certain social distancing measures earlier this week to curb the new spread. Friday was the eighth consecutive day that South Korea has reported a triple-digit daily increase, for an eight-day total of 1,900 infections. Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said Thursday that eligible Mississippians would be able to receive an additional $300 a week in federal aid but not the $100 that was to be provided by the states as suggested by President Donald Trump. \"We will be able to use our current payment as the state's $100 match,\" he said. \"We will see how it works for the next few weeks. I want everyone in Mississippi to know I am grateful to President Trump for stepping in.\" Reeves said the state cannot afford an additional weekly payment of $100 per recipient. – Lici Beveridge, Mississippi Clarion Ledger Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield said Thursday he thinks the outbreak in the South is coming under control. “We are beginning to turn the tide on what I call the Southern outbreak in the nation,” he told the editor of the journal JAMA during a public interview late Thursday.  He credited face masks, social distancing, hand-washing, closing bars and limiting indoor dining in restaurants for the shift. Though it's not in the South, he cited Arizona as an example.  “Arizona put that into play. Two to four weeks later, you really see that we can get control of this pandemic,” he said, noting that stores didn’t have to close, or people lock themselves in their homes. “Be smart about crowds, and we can get this outbreak under control.” It does take time, though, he noted, adding he expects to see the number of deaths — which have been as high as 1,000 a day in recent weeks — falling as soon as next week, a month or more after the state introduced those public health measures. – Karen Weintraub On Facebook: There's still a lot unknown about the coronavirus.

Consumers are less satisfied in general with their rides, but among the Detroit Three, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles can tout some good news in the latest survey of customer satisfaction. The American Customer Satisfaction Index shows that FCA, maker of Ram trucks and Jeep SUVs, actually improved its score compared with a year ago. That can't be said for either General Motors or Ford. The survey is based on interviews with 10,414 customers, \"chosen at random and contacted via email between July 1, 2019, and June 14, 2020,\" so the period covered also includes the initial months of the coronavirus pandemic. Experts weigh in:Should employers force workers to get COVID-19 vaccine? Social Security:The smart way to claim benefits during the pandemic \"Looking at domestic automakers, customer satisfaction results are mixed as both Ford and GM show steep declines while Fiat Chrysler nets a gain. Ford falls furthest this year, tumbling 5% to 76 (on a 0-100 scale), the lowest score among the Detroit Three,\" according to the 2020 American Customer Satisfaction Index report being released Tuesday. That result marks a turnaround for FCA, which had in recent years registered the lowest score of the three companies in the annual survey. FCA also saw a marked improvement from last year. \"A year ago, Fiat Chrysler was the biggest loser in satisfaction, but for 2020, the carmaker rebounds 3% to tie with GM at 77,\" the report said. \"The improvement brings Fiat Chrysler ... in line with both GM and Ford for the first time in five years. While the company benefits from high and stable satisfaction for its Ram nameplate, both Dodge and the self-named Chrysler brand post positive driver satisfaction upswings this year.\" Those improvements for Dodge and Chrysler should note that the two brands bring up the bottom of the list, but the Ram brand, which competes in the profitable pickup segment, is solidly in the top six, which includes Lexus, Audi, Cadillac, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota. But among mass market brands, not counting luxury nameplates, Ram and Toyota are tops.  John McNichol of Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, is sold on Fiat Chrysler's products, although he attributes much of that to the relationship he has with his dealer, David Kelleher, president of David Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram. McNichol, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia, said he met Kelleher years ago at a fundraiser, and that Kelleher and his dealership have done everything right, including at one point talking him out of a more expensive Jeep Wrangler and into a Ram pickup that Kelleher said he knew would be more to his liking. “I've got nothing but good things to say,” McNichol said. Although he used to be \"agnostic\" on car brands, McNichol, who has sent just about everyone he knows to his friend's dealership, has a mini fleet of FCA vehicles in his family now – a Dodge Durango, a Chrysler 300 and both sons drive Jeep Cherokees. And then there's the 2019 Ram 1500 Limited.  “It is just a smoking hot truck,\" McNichol said. \"I love it.” The Ram 1500 runs so much better than his one-time favorite vehicle, a GMC Yukon Denali, McNichol said. That Ram drives like a \"great, upper-end SUV.\" That's quite a testimonial from a current FCA customer. For Ford, and to a lesser degree GM, the news from the survey was troubling. \"A sharp decline for luxury plate Lincoln combined with a smaller drop for the Ford brand pushes the company to a five-year low,\" the report said. \"GM plunges nearly as far, down 4% to 77, beating Ford by a point. While GMC trucks hold steady for customer satisfaction, the company's Buick and Chevrolet nameplates both retreat to record-low satisfaction levels.\" The declines, however, are not unique to GM and Ford, with 17 brands posting declines year over year. European carmakers hold a lead over Asian and U.S. companies. \"For both domestic and international carmakers, customer satisfaction is now at its lowest level in five years,\" the report said.  Luxury brands, with a 4% decline, were hit harder than mass market brands, which dropped 1%.  The report did offer a way for at least some automakers to boost their customer satisfaction ratings: Improve how they handle recalls. \"The brands that experience the strongest negative impact of recalls on satisfaction this year are two Fiat Chrysler plates, Ram and Jeep, along with luxury plates Cadillac and Mercedes-Benz. For these brands, customer satisfaction would be significantly higher if their handling of the recall process improved,\" the report said. The auto industry can take some comfort in knowing that it's nowhere near the bottom of industries ranked by the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Subscription TV services, Internet service providers and video-on-demand services round out the bottom. Americans apparently love their breweries, which, as an industry, is tops for satisfaction. \"The ACSI was started in the United States in 1994 by researchers at the University of Michigan, in conjunction with the American Society for Quality in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and CFI Group in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Index was developed to provide information on satisfaction with the quality of products and services available to consumers. Before the ACSI, no national measure of quality from the perspective of the user was available,\" according to survey's website. Contact Eric D. Lawrence: elawrence@freepress.com.

But, also look to these places: President Donald Trump called for a $300-per-week federally funded jobless benefit for workers who were unemployed due to the pandemic, with states asked to provide another $100 a week. Unemployed workers who receive less than $100 in state benefits won't receive the extra $300 because their weekly benefit would fall short of triggering the state match to get the federal funds. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter: @JessicaMenton. The $400 in extra unemployment aid for millions of out-of-work Americans is actually $300 in most states. And it won’t arrive for weeks, experts warn. Americans may just get three weeks’ worth of payments, according to guidance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which will run the relief program through its Disaster Relief Fund, following an executive action from President Donald Trump this month.  After coronavirus aid talks hit a stalemate in Congress, Trump called for a $300-per-week federally funded jobless benefit for workers who were unemployed due to the pandemic, with states asked to provide another $100 a week. The Trump administration is tapping up to $44 billion in FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for the $300 in aid. But the amount could be cut at any moment if the funds are needed for their usual purpose of natural-disaster relief, experts say. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter: @JessicaMenton. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on August 8 that will provide an additional $400 per week in unemployment benefits to millions of out-of-work Americans following the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.  It’s unclear whether Trump has the authority to extend enhanced unemployment benefits by executive action while side-stepping Congress. It lowers the weekly bonus to $400 from the extra $600 that expired in late July, with states being asked to cover 25% of the costs. That means the federal government will provide $300 a week. And it could take months for states to implement. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter: @JessicaMenton. ... He was called back to work July 27. Who does he contact to get the benefits? The $600 benefit was due to those receiving unemployment until it ended at the end of July. He should contact his state unemployment office. — Charisse Jones Follow Charisse on Twitter @charissejones. More than two-thirds of workers on jobless benefits are making more in unemployment than they did while working, and one in five eligible unemployed workers will receive benefits at least twice as large as their lost earnings, according to economists at the University of Chicago. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter @JessicaMenton Yes. Unless Congress takes immediate action, the extra $600 will end on July 25 in every state but New York where it will end on July 26.  — Charisse Jones Follow Charisse on Twitter @charissejones State unemployment programs only cover about 41% of someone’s lost wages, according to The Brookings Institution. The average hourly wage in the U.S. is $25.72. Congress aimed to cover 100% of lost wages given the severity of the recession. But customizing the benefits to match people’s salaries posed challenges due to outdated state unemployment systems. In March, Congress opted to give Americans a $600 bonus payment to equal the average wage, or about $1,000 per week. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter @JessicaMenton  In some states, the benefit will shrink by more than half. In Arizona, the maximum weekly benefit is $240. In Florida, Alabama, and Tennessee, it is $275 per week. Check with your state’s department to determine what your benefit will be. — Charisse Jones and Jessica Menton Follow Charisse and Jessica on Twitter @charissejones and @JessicaMenton That’s unclear. Currently, another coronavirus relief package likely won’t be approved until after July, policymakers say. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter @JessicaMenton  You can't collect jobless benefits if you quit a job because of a general fear of the virus. However, if your job site is truly unsafe, you might have grounds to refuse to return and get financial assistance while you are out of work. A worker who's particularly vulnerable because of underlying health conditions or a compromised immune system could apply for pandemic-related aid, says Michele Evermore, senior researcher and policy analyst with the National Employment Law Project (NELP). Also, if you can't return to work because you are looking after a relative who contracted COVID-19, or a child whose school or day care center remains closed because of the virus, you could also be eligible for financial help. — Charisse Jones Follow Charisse on Twitter @charissejones    I heard 'it should be' or that 'it should automatically update to be retroactive.' Could Florida be withholding funds? If you get any unemployment assistance at all, the $600 from the federal government is supposed to accompany it. And yes it is retroactive. — Charisse Jones Follow Charisse on Twitter @charissejones ... I thought the CARES Act was supposed to help. I'm losing my entire mortgage payment per month and my hours have decreased, but I don't qualify for anything, the unemployment office said. Each state has its own guidelines, according to the Department of Labor, but you may be eligible for unemployment if you: The CARES Act can support short-term compensation programs where employers reduce hours instead of laying off, and employees receive prorated unemployment benefits. But it depends on your state, according to Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant at TurboTax. Some states don’t allow partial unemployment benefits and some are modifying existing laws to allow partial unemployment benefits. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter: @JessicaMenton. ... My employer called me back to work in early June and I went back for four days before filling out the form for an unpaid leave of absence. People at work were not social distancing or wearing masks and they also were touching my equipment in my presence. If you have been advised by a healthcare professional to self-quarantine to avoid health risks, you may be eligible for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance if all other eligibility requirements are met, Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant at TurboTax, says. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter: @JessicaMenton. ... Will it continue or has it stopped for New Jersey? Do you need to contact anyone? If you are still receiving unemployment benefits, the extra $600 should continue until July 25 in New Jersey. If the missed money doesn’t show up in your next payment, you should contact the state’s unemployment benefits office. — Charisse Jones Follow Charisse on Twitter @charissejones. If you are back to work full time, you will no longer receive jobless benefits. If you are back to work part-time, you can receive partial unemployment insurance which should include the extra $600 a week. But how much a person can earn from work and still receive unemployment differs greatly depending on the state, and the cutoff threshold can be quite low.  You can check page 17 of the following link to get a state by state breakdown. — Charisse Jones Follow Charisse on Twitter @charissejones. The additional $600 in weekly jobless benefits provided by the federal government is officially set to end July 31. But states will pay it only through the week ending July 25 or July 26, a significant blow to unemployed workers counting on that money to bolster state benefits that average just $370 a week. \"The (Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation) $600 can be paid for weeks ending no later than the week ending prior to Friday, July 31, 2020,'' the U.S. Department of Labor said in a statement. \"For all states except (New York), that is Saturday, July 25th. New York’s end date is Sunday, July 26th.\" The confusion lies in the fine print. Unemployment benefits are paid by states on a weekly or biweekly basis with a defined end date on Saturday or Sunday. But the federal legislation known as the CARES Act, which authorized the additional compensation, says the benefit will end “on or before July 31” – a Friday. That means, given the payment schedules of most states, the last week of the extra $600 payments will end the prior Saturday or Sunday.  — Charisse Jones, Coral Murphy-Marcos and Brent Schrotenboer No. “Someone who has no earnings and no attachment to the workforce since August 2018, and is not unemployed or partially employed as a result of COVID is not eligible for benefits,” said Jason Moon, a spokesman for the Unemployment Insurance Agency in Michigan. And that’s likely to be the same response from most states, if not all states, according to experts. Rachael Kohl, director of the Workers’ Rights Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School, said it’s highly unlikely anyone in that situation of voluntarily leaving the work force in 2018 and not returning would be able to collect any jobless benefits now. “If you weren’t trying to work, you don’t get to collect unemployment benefits now,” Kohl said. — Susan Tompor Follow Susan on Twitter: @tompor. There are a few ways you can pay taxes on your unemployment. You can choose to have them taken out when applying online for jobless benefits for some states. Or you can fill out Federal Form W-4V Voluntary Withholding Request and have federal taxes automatically have taxes taken out, according to Greene-Lewis. When you fill out the form you can request to have up to 10% taken out, she added.  Once you are working again, if you have an employer you can adjust your federal tax withholding using Form W-4. If you are self-employed, you can make adjustments in your estimated tax payments when it is time to pay. The first and second federal estimated tax deadlines were extended to July 15. At tax-time you may be able to offset your taxes which some of the credits you were not eligible for in the past if your income is lower like the Earned Income Tax Credit worth up to $6,660 in tax year 2020 for a family with three kids, the Saver’s credit worth up to $1,000 single and $2,000 married filing jointly, or the Child and Dependent Care Credit worth up to $1,050 with one child and up to $2,100 with two or more kids. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter: @JessicaMenton. ... I don't know how many of my clients are ready to come back and get a massage. Can I do this until I get a better idea of when my business will be back to normal? In general, as long as you make less with your reduced schedule than the amount you are receiving in unemployment then you can claim Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, according to Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant at TurboTax. States have different rules on how much you can earn and still be eligible, so check those details with your individual state. Also, keep a record of how much you work and make sure you report the amount you make to your state, she added.  ... Would I still get the full $600 per week if I did this?  Yes, if you qualify for unemployment based on your state requirements you should qualify for the additional $600 under Federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter: @JessicaMenton. You may as long as you haven’t exceeded the amount of weeks eligible for unemployment. Under PUA, the amount of weeks was extended to 39 weeks. With unemployment you don’t have to use all of the weeks consecutively. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter: @JessicaMenton. You should. The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program allows a much larger pool of workers to get jobless benefits when their work is affected by the virus. Check online with your state’s unemployment office to get more clarity. — Charisse Jones Follow Charisse on Twitter @charissejones. The $600 is in addition to the amount determined under state law, according to the CARES Act. This means you can calculate what you are eligible to receive by any state and add on the $600. It doesn’t say it is per claim or per state, says Toby Mathis, a partner and attorney at Anderson Law Group in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Department of Labor says that when you file for unemployment for two jobs where one of the jobs is outside of your state of residence, you should file with the state in which you reside and make them aware of the claim in another state, he added. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter: @JessicaMenton. ... I know I can't say no to work and I know that if I make more than 50% of my unemployment my benefits will be reduced. Is that based off my state unemployment benefit? If you are once again employed, you won’t qualify for jobless benefits — Charisse Jones Follow Charisse on Twitter @charissejones. Unemployment benefits, including the $600 weekly federal benefit, are subject to both federal and state income taxes. In some cases, you can elect out of withholding. You will, however, still owe taxes on the benefit come tax time. Federal taxes are usually withheld at 10% and the state taxes depend on your state of residence. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter: @JessicaMenton. ... I actually came to Nepal for vacation, but because of the pandemic I’m stuck here longer than I was supposed to be. You can still apply with your state of residence, but the answer will depend on the rules they have in place. Most states have a number of hours requirement or compensation earned requirement prior to allowing benefits along with rules such as being unemployed through no fault of your own, and that you are actively seeking work, according to Toby Mathis, a partner and attorney at Anderson Law Group in Las Vegas, Nevada. Many states have modified the last requirement during the pandemic to eliminate the seeking work requirement, but not all. Some states have added additional eligibility for those who are adversely affected by pandemic, Mathis says. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter: @JessicaMenton. ... Retired, income below $60000, filed taxes 2018 and 2019, same bank same account and received automatic deposits from IRS before.  Tax professionals suggest checking the Get My Payment tool on the IRS website to monitor your status.

It depends. If you are collecting the pension from the company that laid you off, you might not qualify for unemployment.

Are rents going to be cheaper and more housing available? It depends. The Federal Reserve signaled it won't raise borrowing costs for the foreseeable future, a potential boon for homebuyers as mortgage rates slide. But finding a home at a favorable price could be a challenge. While the pandemic has eased affordability, it has also prompted many sellers to delay listing their homes. That’s made finding a home in most markets more difficult as inventory has fallen. Tightening lending standards and limited inventory may create barriers for potential first-time buyers, who also typically have a harder time putting up money for down payment. U.S. home prices haven’t budged much. One reason why: buyer demand will prevent U.S. home prices from falling more than 2% to 3% through the end of the year, according to real estate search site Zillow – it expects to see a steady price recovery in 2021. There has been a slowdown in the rental market. It’s still too early to see the full effects of the pandemic on rent overall, but prices in some areas are on the decline. In San Francisco, for instance, rent for a one-bedroom dropped 1.4% to $3,450 on a monthly basis and is down 6.8% from a year ago, rental platform Zumper said in its National Rent Report for May. New York City, meanwhile, saw rent rise 3.5% to $2,950 on a monthly basis after dropping 5% the prior month. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter: @JessicaMenton. It depends. The $600 weekly benefit may still be paid after someone's state unemployment runs out, depending on the circumstances that cause that person to remain unemployed, according to Christina Taylor, head of operations at Credit Karma Tax.  If you were laid off by your employer due to the pandemic, you're not in a COVID-19 high risk group, and your employer has called you back to work and you don't go back, you will no longer receive state unemployment benefits, she says.   You would also no longer receive the extra $600 per week benefit you'd been receiving up until that point. This is because choosing to be unemployed or not going back to work when your place of work is no longer closed due to the virus is not normally a qualifying reason for PUA benefits. “If you were furloughed by your employer due to COVID-19 and you were called back to work, but you can't go back because your child's school or summer child care program is closed due to COVID-19, you would most likely still qualify for PUA benefits until the end of July 2020 or when your child's care provider opens back up, whichever comes earlier,” Taylor says. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter: @JessicaMenton. The extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits will expire after July 31, if the Senate doesn’t pass the $3 trillion HEROES Act – another emergency stimulus package that would extend the additional $600 benefit into January 2021. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter: @JessicaMenton. If you are forced to resign from your job because you have a child that requires care and are unable to obtain child care because your care provider is closed due to the coronavirus, then you may qualify for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, according to Christina Taylor, head of operations at Credit Karma Tax. PUA is the federal portion of unemployment that is an additional $600 per week you can receive in addition to the State Unemployment Assistance you may receive. Every state's unemployment program is different, so it's important to check your state's rules because some states may allow for state unemployment assistance if you're in this situation. If your child would normally be in school, but their school is closed due to the virus, then you could qualify for PUA if you resign due to not having childcare. Once the normal school year is out, however, you would no longer qualify for federal unemployment assistance, unless your child's summer care provider, like a summer camp or a summer babysitter, is also closed due to the pandemic, Taylor says. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter: @JessicaMenton. ...

My hours have been reduced, plus a 10% salary decrease. If I'm eligible for the extra $600, should I keep certifying with unemployment each week, so that I can receive that or should I stop certifying, as it will be sent to me anyway? If you do not qualify for your state’s unemployment insurance, you might try applying for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program in your state. The program helps unemployed people who are business owners, self-employed, independent contractors, have limited work history or those not usually eligible for regular state unemployment benefits who are out of business or services are significantly reduced as a direct result of the pandemic. Once you are approved for PUA, the extra $600 would be added, as well. — Josh Rivera Follow Josh on Twitter: @Josh1Rivera. That’s unlikely.

Also, if you start taking Social Security, you only have one opportunity to withdraw. It must be within 12 months and you must repay all benefits.  — Alfred Miller Follow Alfred on Twitter @alfredfmiller. Unemployment benefits are taxable income.

It also will explain how you can alert the IRS if anything needs to be corrected. — Michael Collins Follow Michael on Twitter @mcollinsNEWS.  I checked the IRS website to see where my payment is and it said it was deposited in that account. Ken Milani, professor of accountancy at the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame, suggests that you first contact the bank to see what happened there. If the bank has the money, be prepared to verify your identity. Most likely, the money may have been returned to the IRS. The IRS states at its Economic Impact Payments Information Center, Question No. 33, that: “If the account is closed or no longer active, the bank will reject the deposit and you will be issued a check that will be mailed to the address we have on file for you. This is generally the address on your most recent tax return or as updated through the United States Postal Service (USPS). You do not need to call the IRS to change your Payment method or update your address at this time.” In addition, the IRS states: “As required by law and for security reasons, a letter about the Payment will be mailed to each recipient’s last known address within 15 days after the Payment is made. The letter will provide information on how the Payment was made and how to report any failure to receive the Payment.” — Susan Tompor Follow Susan on Twitter: @tompor. According to the IRS, if a stimulus check is sent to a recipient through direct deposit and the bank information is invalid or the bank account has been closed, the bank will reject the deposit. At that point, the IRS will mail the payment as soon as possible to the address they have on file for you, typically within 14 days. You can learn more about accessing your payment through the GetMyPayment page on the IRS web site. — Ledyard King Follow Ledyard on Twitter @LedgeKing. My coworker may have gotten Covid-19 from a patient at his second job. Because of this, I fear that I have been exposed to the virus and that if I continue to work at the facility, I will continue to be exposed.  Generally, you can only qualify for unemployment if you lost your job due to COVID-19, you’ve left your job to take care of family member who’s been infected, or you’re quarantining on the advice of a health-care provider and you’re unable to perform your duties. The U.S. Department of Labor recommends that if you believe your employer’s response to the possible spread of COVID-19 creates “a serious safety hazard” or if you think your employer is not following federal work safety standards, you can file a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. — Ledyard King Follow Ledyard on Twitter @LedgeKing. Like many things relating to the Economic Impact Payments, there does not appear to be a clear cut answer here. TurboTax said: “We are seeing some TurboTax customers who chose to receive their refund on a debit card get their stimulus payments to these accounts. Any TurboTax debit card customer who receives a stimulus payment from the IRS to that account, will receive that stimulus payment without delay or fees.” At the same time, TurboTax recommends that people check the IRS Get My Payment tool to find out how they will receive their stimulus payment from the IRS and when. TurboTax noted that the IRS is responsible for determining taxpayer eligibility of receiving a stimulus and, if a taxpayer is eligible, how and when the stimulus payments will be delivered to them.  The IRS is asking people to submit direct deposit information by noon May 13 at Get My Payment at IRS.gov before a steady flow of paper checks will be issued. — Susan Tompor Follow Susan on Twitter: @tompor. ... A family member just received her stimulus benefit via direct deposit. Thing is, she’s been dead for three years. Are we required to give the money back? Here's what the IRS said people need to do if they must return an Economic Impact Payment, such as one issued to a deceased person.  If the payment was a paper check: And if you cashed that paper check already, or you received the stimulus money via direct deposit, the IRS said you should:  The IRS could try to charge you interest and penalties at some point if you do not return the money.  — Susan Tompor Follow Susan on Twitter: @tompor. If you were claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return for 2019, you are out of luck for now. However, the stimulus payments are technically an advance credit on your 2020 taxes, so you could possibly claim the payment when you file your 2020 returns early next year, as long as someone else does not claim you as a dependent for 2020. — Michael Collins Follow Michael on Twitter @mcollinsNEWS.  No. The maximum benefit is based on your previous income. The $600 is an extra that the unemployed can receive through the end of July. — Charisse Jones Follow Charisse on Twitter @charissejones. ... The jobs I qualify for are considered nonessential and it's dangerous to be out trying to find work right now while taking care of my elderly brother. We are receiving food stamps. You may be eligible for a stimulus payment once you file a 2019 tax return. Current inmates cannot get a payment, but ex-offenders can qualify, even if they have no income. If you do not file with the IRS right now, you could be eligible for the stimulus payment when you file a 2020 return next year. You also may be eligible for unemployment benefits, including the additional $600 per week in enhanced benefits  that the federal government has approved to help mitigate the financial impact of the coronavirus. Rules for unemployment benefits vary from state to state, but to qualify, you usually need to be actively looking for work and cannot turn down a job offer. — Michael Collins Follow Michael on Twitter @mcollinsNEWS.  The first thing to check is if you qualify to receive a stimulus check under the CARES Act guidelines. If you do, it's important to remember that the government is sending out the payments in installments. Payments were prioritized in order from lowest income to highest income. For those with direct deposit information on file with the IRS, payments began going out on April 10. And last week to Social Security beneficiaries, railroad retirees and veterans who aren’t required to file a tax return, which will continue through May. While the IRS started mailing checks in late April to those who qualify but do not have direct deposit information, that process might take several months. — Sarah Skidmore Associated Press The IRS updated its \"Get My Payment\" tool to fix some headaches. But some people continue to get error messages in some cases. The IRS advises that you go back and check your most recent tax return or consider whether there is a different way to enter your street address (for example, 123 N Main St vs 123 North Main St).  \"You may also verify how your address is formatted with the U.S. Postal Service by entering your address in the USPS ZIP Lookup tool, and then enter your address into Get My Payment exactly as it appears on file with USPS,\" the IRS said.  — Susan Tompor Follow Susan on Twitter: @tompor. If you had health coverage through your employer and lost your job, or if you received coverage as the dependent of someone who lost their job due to the pandemic, you could qualify for a special enrollment period to access the Affordable Care Act’s health exchange. If your lack of coverage is not related to the virus, then you have to wait until the fall to access the exchange. Regardless, anyone is eligible to receive a free COVID-19 test even if they’re not insured. — Ledyard King Follow Ledyard on Twitter @LedgeKing. Electronic filers are generally getting their money before those who mailed in their latest tax return because it’s easy to transfer the money to bank accounts they have on record. Regardless of how you filed, you can track your expected payment using the IRS Get My Payment tool. The timing of checks for those who filed paper returns last year is being complicated by the IRS' decision to stop processing paper returns due to COVID-19. That means there’s a delay not only in issuing checks but in determining how much you’re eligible to receive. — Ledyard King Follow Ledyard on Twitter @LedgeKing. ... or $600 every two weeks added to your unemployment benefits?

My employer is considered essential, but they have reduced hours for others. Situations like this will likely be handled on a case by case basis. Employers have, of course, the right to protest a claim. But states are encouraging employers to make accommodations for individuals with health risks, whether it’s allowing them to work from home or in a safe work environment. If that’s not possible, then such individuals could be eligible for unemployment insurance.  — Alfred Miller Follow Alfred on Twitter @alfredfmiller.

You can apply for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) for your state. — Charisse Jones Follow Charisse on Twitter @charissejones. ... How can we find out if he applied for the paycheck loan? He said he was but we don't trust him. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) does not require businesses to rehire the same people that were laid off. It only requires that the loan will be forgiven if at least 75% of the total amount is spent on personnel with the remainder on work-related costs, such as rent, mortgage or utilities. If you believe your boss has acted improperly or illegally, you could contact your local or state labor agency to file a complaint. — Ledyard King Follow Ledyard on Twitter @LedgeKing. Different states may handle this situation differently. But it’s generally not the state’s desire to be punitive. In Kentucky, for example, the state is offering individuals who find themselves in this situation the opportunity to negotiate the amount that is withheld from their current benefits until the debt is paid back.  — Alfred Miller Follow Alfred on Twitter @alfredfmiller. Yes, under the CARES Act, people who lost jobs due to the coronavirus before they could start them can get financial assistance. — Charisse Jones Follow Charisse on Twitter @charissejones.

I applied for unemployment benefits on March 16 and still don’t receive any response or money. How can we can survive?  Various organizations are offering more immediate assistance, including some specific to restaurant workers like chef Edward Lee’s Restaurant Workers Relief Program. That particular organization is distributing food and supplies from locations across the country, including Sqirl in Los Angeles.

Additionally, Feeding America helps people identify local food banks across the nation.  — Alfred Miller Follow Alfred on Twitter @alfredfmiller How unemployment benefits are calculated varies by state, but even those who don’t qualify for unemployment are automatically considered for the new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program that was created as part of the CARES Act. PUA aids people who are unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic but do not qualify for traditional unemployment insurance. The PUA benefit rate is based on recent earnings, with recipients also getting the additional $600 per week.  — Alfred Miller Follow Alfred on Twitter @alfredfmiller Bringing staff back at their regular wage through the Paycheck Protection Program will result in them earning less than they are getting on unemployment. This doesn't seem right. Why would they return? Several Republican senators brought up the very same issue during the debate on the first stimulus bill passed in March, saying it would encourage some people to collect unemployment rather than work. But both the Trump administration and most Democrats argued the $600 boost was necessary because unemployment benefits alone in many states would not restore their full pay before the crisis. They don’t believe most workers, such as front-line health care responders, would choose staying home over staying on the job. — Ledyard King Follow Ledyard on Twitter @LedgeKing Yes, the federal government has created the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program. It aids people who are unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic but do not qualify for traditional unemployment insurance. People who don’t qualify for unemployment are automatically considered for PUA. The PUA benefit rate is based on recent earnings, with recipients also getting the additional $600 per week. — Alfred Miller Follow Alfred on Twitter @alfredfmiller No, people aged 17 and older who can be claimed as someone else’s dependent are left out of the plan. In other words, many college students won't receive the $1,200 and their status won't entitle their parents to receive an additional $500.  — Alfred Miller Follow Alfred on Twitter @alfredfmiller An individual can go to the IRS and attempt to pursue a matter like this at https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment. — Alfred Miller Follow Alfred on Twitter @alfredfmiller No. Stimulus checks aren’t taxable income.

The credits will be applied to 2020 tax returns, but are advanced to taxpayers now based on their 2019 or 2018 adjusted gross income.  — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter @JessicaMenton. While many people received their stimulus deposit, other payments may have gotten inadvertently sent to temporary accounts created during the tax filing process. The IRS said it is moving to provide additional information and resolve any issues as soon as possible. After you file your taxes with a tax professional, transfer banks such as MetaBank, Republic Bank and Santa Barbara Tax Product Group set up temporary accounts for taxpayers who want a refund advance or to deduct tax preparation fees from a refund.  \"Those last four digits on the Get My Payment portal match the transfer provider's information that has been submitted to the IRS,\" said Natalie Parchment, a tax preparation consultant. — Dalvin Brown and Jessica Menton Follow Dalvin on Twitter @dalvin_brown and Jessica on @JessicaMenton. Yes. Unemployment benefits are considered taxable income, according to the IRS. Those benefits typically last for 26 weeks, but Congress added 13 additional weeks on top of that for a total of 39 weeks. Unemployed workers will get an extra $600 per week of unemployment benefits on top of their unemployment checks, which will be paid retroactively to March 29 or when you became unemployed. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter @JessicaMenton. No. If the amount of the credit a taxpayer qualifies for in 2020 is less than it was based on their 2019 return, it doesn’t have to be paid back, according to the Tax Foundation. If your income is less in 2020, you will receive the difference of the credit if it is in your favor. If your income drops this year, for instance, you’ll be eligible for any remaining credit that you weren’t able to claim using your 2019 or 2018 return.  — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter @JessicaMenton. ...

It blocks the IRS from garnishing your tax refund for those late loan payments. Also, the government won't ding your wages or withhold social security payments for six months under the relief package. ... What if my tax refund was already garnished? If your tax refund was withheld because you defaulted on a federal student loan on or after March 13, which was the day President Donald Trump declared a national emergency, it will be returned to you, according to the Department of Education. That also applies to garnished wages and withheld Social Security benefits. ... Does it apply to private loans? No. Private debt collectors could still garnish student loan debts. If you have trouble paying, contact your lender for options. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter @JessicaMenton. ... or child support? ... or overdue on student loan payments? While the CARES Act suspends debts like overdue student loans or back taxes that typically lead to the garnishment of tax refunds, it doesn't apply to delinquent child support payments. That means the government's relief checks will still be garnished if you're overdue. And some spouses who are filing joint tax returns with their late-paying partners are upset their stimulus money is being trimmed or withheld, even if they typically qualify for relief in situations like tax refunds. Even if your spouse is solely responsible for the debt, a shared tax refund or stimulus check could be at risk. .... If I owe child support, does the stimulus money go to my ex? The stimulus payment that is reduced or withheld by the child support owed will go to the appropriate collecting office for the taxpayer's state. From there, that collecting office will issue the money to the custodial parent, the person due the child support.  More information here. — Jessica Menton Follow Jessica on Twitter @JessicaMenton. The Internal Revenue Service is expected to launch an online tool as soon as Wednesday to get a better clue on when you'll see your Economic Impact Payment via IRS.gov/eip. The IRS said the tool will let you go online to check the status of a payment, including the date it's scheduled to be deposited or mailed. If you do not see the money in your bank account in two weeks, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said you can go to IRS.gov to see \"Get My Payment.\" If you filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return and did not receive a stimulus payment, he said, make sure to have your tax return information available to use at the \"Get My Payment\" tool later this week. — Susan Tompor Follow Susan on Twitter: @tompor. Taxpayers are telling their friends, and yes, posting news on social media, that they're already seeing stimulus cash arrive in their bank accounts. Some consumers spotted the first direct deposits as early as Saturday; others started seeing more information as of Monday. The IRS even tweeted Saturday evening that the agency deposited the first Economic Impact Payments into bank accounts on Saturday. Some people in Michigan who checked their bank accounts online in the past few days spotted that $1,200 or more will be available in their bank accounts as of April 15. Interestingly: The wording being used is \"IRS Treas 310\" (cut-in Michigan) so don't expect to see words like \"stimulus checks\" or \"recovery rebate\" or \"economic impact payment\" on your bank statement.  — Susan Tompor Follow Susan on Twitter: @tompor. Social Security beneficiaries and other Americans who haven’t filed income taxes for the past two years won’t have to take any extra steps to receive one-time checks.  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the IRS will use Social Security data to generate payments to recipients who did not file tax returns in 2018 or 2019.  — Michael Collins Follow Michael on Twitter @mcollinsNEWS.  As long as your adjusted gross income in 2019 was no more than $99,000 (if you file separately) or $198,000 (if you file jointly), you will receive some money.

You’ll have to download this form and then find an eligible lender, such as an SBA-certified local bank or commercial lender. You can still borrow the money if you don’t meet the 75% payroll requirement but you’ll have to pay it back with 1% interest within two years. — Ledyard King Follow Ledyard on Twitter @LedgeKing.

Strong sales trends are continuing into the first few weeks of 2020 with same-store sales up 11% in the current quarter, the company reported. \"Sporting goods retailers will fare better in the age of COVID-19 social distancing, with elevated interest we're seeing for fitness equipment and pent up demand for outdoor recreation amid a favorable seasonal backdrop as stay-at-home orders are lifted,\" CFRA analyst Camilla Yanushevsky wrote in a note to investors following Wednesday's earnings release.  Other large retailers such as Target and Walmart have also reported strong second-quarter sales, with particular strength in online sales. Profit margins increased on in-store and digital purchases, company officials said in a morning conference call, and the curbside pickup and online initiatives are attracting a fair share of new customers to the store. \"It's really encouraging they figured out E-commerce at the right time,\" said Nick Shields, an analyst with Third Bridge in Manhattan, noting that Dick's has benefitted in what appears to be a cultural shift in consumer preferences to social-distancing friendly sports such as golfing, fishing and kayaking. The sole disappointment in Dick's projections are back-to-school sales, which executives said are underperforming because of the uncertain status of the academic year and fall sports as districts formulate strategies to prevent the virus spread. Strong categories included footwear, apparel and hardlines. \"The golf business has been great in both Dick's and Golf Galaxy,\" Stack said. \"Men, women and kids have jumped into the category.\" Dick's restored the dividend and announced the 15% pay premium for workers will be extended through the balance of the year. \"Dick's is the 'last man standing' in sporting goods following the bankruptcies of Sports Authority, Modell's, etc. Dick's robust omni solutions (curbside; most orders two business days) with further enhancements are set to rival Amazon,\" Yanushevsky said.  The improved results come even as some segments of the public pledged to boycott the chain after its controversial decision to halt the sale of semi-automatic weapons and remove hunting gear from more than 500 Dick's stores. \"We're not changing our position on that,\" Stack said Wednesday. The company was founded 75 years ago as a single bait and tackle shop on Binghamton's East Side, but began its aggressive expansion in the mid-1980s when Ed Stack took over from his father, Dick. The company relocated headquarters from Binghamton to Pittsburgh in 1994.  Jeff Platsky covers transportation and the economy for the USA TODAY Network New York.

Some super small checks — averaging $18 a pop — began flooding mailboxes in the past week as the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service sent interest payments to cover delays in federal income tax refunds for some 2019 returns.  My college-age son received his check for $2.26 in interest this weekend. Yes, that won't even cover a typical run to Taco Bell for the $5 box meal.  The interest payments are being made to 13.9 million taxpayers who experienced unusual delays in receiving their tax refunds this year.  Save better, spend better:Money tips and advice delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here The payments are being made to people who filed a 2019 return by this year's July 15 deadline and either received a refund in the past three months or will receive a refund in the future, according to the IRS. Most interest payments will be issued separately from the tax refunds themselves. Most people — roughly 12 million — will receive these small payments via direct deposit, not paper checks, the same way they receive their tax refunds. The rest, though, will get a check. Some people might even wonder if the checks are real.  Signs that it's a legitimate check include: The check will say \"INT\" at the left hand corner. And you will see the words \"Tax Refund\" at the bottom as well. You'll want to keep a record of these interest payments because they're going to be taxable, according to the IRS. The IRS notes: \"By law, these interest payments are taxable and taxpayers who receive them must report the interest on the 2020 federal income tax return they file next year. In January 2021, the IRS will send a Form 1099-INT to anyone who receives interest totaling at least $10.\"  Nothing, of course, has sounded particularly normal this year when it comes to taxes, tax refunds and stimulus checks.  In mid-August, some readers who had filed in March told me that they had still not received their income tax refunds. The IRS had noted a string of delays involving the filing of paper returns as a result of what it calls \"COVID-19 mail processing delays.\"  The IRS stated online: \"We’re experiencing delays in processing paper tax returns due to limited staffing. If you already filed a paper return, we will process it in the order we received it. Do not file a second tax return or contact the IRS about the status of your return.\"  You can check your refund status online at \"Where's my refund?\" https://sa.www4.irs.gov/irfof/lang/en/irfofgetstatus.jsp COVID-19 vaccine:Should employers force workers to get one? New tool for homebuyers:Measurement assesses flood risk on a new home The latest interest payments involve refunds but even the interest payment isn't typical. It's different, the IRS noted, from a long-standing 45-day rule, which generally mandates that the IRS add interest to refunds on timely filed returns when the refund ends up being issued more than 45 days after the return due date. \"Instead, this year's COVID-19-related July 15 due date is considered a disaster-related postponement of the filing deadline,\" the IRS said in its press release. \"Where a disaster-related postponement exists, the IRS is required, by law, to pay interest, calculated from the original April 15 filing deadline, as long as an individual files a 2019 federal income tax return by the postponed deadline — July 15, 2020, in this instance. This refund interest requirement only applies to individual income tax filers — businesses are not eligible.\"  The rate for the second quarter ending June 30 was 5%, compounded daily. Effective July 1, the rate for the third quarter dropped to 3%, compounded daily, the IRS said.  No interest will be added to any refund issued before the original April 15 deadline. And yes, the con artists might be aware of some of this delay to the tax season payouts, making it important to remain vigilant  when it comes to spotting potential scams.  I received an email the other day from my bank that said: \"Direct Deposit Payment On Hold.\"  Yes, it looked like it was from my bank.  Sender, supposedly: \"US Fedral BNFT PYMNT.\"  \"A direct deposit payment with the below information is currently on hold for verification before we can complete the deposit into your account with us.\"  The email, helpfully, suggests that I click on a link to \"complete verification here.\"  The small problem? If you look back at the email, it's not being sent from any bank. It's from 1falcon@mtaonline.net. It's not from my bank at all.  Other signs of phishing fraud: The message didn't address me by name.

Over 71 percent of consumers are more comfortable traveling by car than plane this summer, according to Nissan. Meanwhile, more than 60 percent of recent adoptions are by those with little or no previous pet experience, a Rover report found.  “Often drivers may hit the road and just have their pet jump in the back seat for the ride.

Run a seat belt through a loop on the back of the pet harness, or under the back or the harness itself. Always consult the pet harness information manual for instruction on proper vehicle use. This is an excellent solution to ensure that medium- to large-size dogs stay seated during a trip. Another option is using a pet restraint tether, often referred to as a pet seat belt. This type of restraint offers an inexpensive and quick solution for securing pets. As the name implies, this restraint clips to the pet’s collar or harness and is often affixed to your vehicle by either clipping into the seatbelt buckle or child-seat anchor to help keep your dog from moving around the vehicle. Utilizing a secured pet carrier or kennel is another way to travel safely with pets. Smaller dogs can be housed in portable carriers that can be secured in the vehicle’s second row using seat belts or pillows to help limit movement. Smaller carriers can also be placed on the floor behind one of the front seats. Medium- and large-sized pets should be placed in a sturdier kennel secured to the vehicle cargo area in SUVs or trucks. In either instance, the kennel should be fastened to the vehicle as securely as possible. Cargo area dividers can be used to help keep pets behind the last row of an SUV. These are a great way to keep large dogs out of the occupant space when traveling. It’s best to still secure the pet in the cargo area."}, {"id": "usatoday34", "publisher": "usatoday", "label": "left-center", "title": "Calls to legalize weed and create a new source of revenue have taken on fresh urgency as Pennsylvania faces a potentially years-long financial crisis.", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/08/26/pennsylvania-marijuana-legalization-supported-by-gov-tom-wolf/5634466002/", "section": "business", "date": "2020-08-26-09PM", "body": "YORK, Pa. – Calls to legalize weed and create a new source of revenue have taken on fresh urgency as Pennsylvania faces a years-long financial crisis following the coronavirus outbreak. Gov. Tom Wolf is calling on the Pennsylvania legislature to legalize recreational marijuana and use the tax revenue to help small businesses that have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic has steered Pennsylvania’s economy into a recession. And although programs such as the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and the Paycheck Protection Program have helped some, Wolf said, more needs to be done. \"Repairing the damage of this pandemic is not going to be easy,\" Wolf said at a news conference Tuesday. \"The legislature can act right now to get us back on track as quickly as we possibly can.\" He wants to see more money provided to front-line workers and working parents, and be used to create more grants to support small businesses. Wolf said the government could fund these efforts with the $1.3 billion it has left from federal coronavirus stimulus relief and from the revenue from legalization of recreational marijuana. From 2019:Still hazy, but here's what Pennsylvania might look like if legal weed becomes a thing Pennsylvania created infrastructure to begin regulating the medical marijuana industry when the Legislature passed bills to oversee and tax medical weed in 2016. And since then, Wolf and Lt. Gov. John Fetterman have been vocal about their support for full legalization in Pennsylvania. Eleven states have already legalized marijuana for adult use, and Senate Bill 350, which has come to be known as the \"gold standard\" legalization bill, is ready and waiting for Pennsylvania's legislature to act on it. But this industry is no stranger to delays, and lawmakers failed to pass similar bills before.  \"The inclusion of cannabis legalization in Governor Wolf’s Fall agenda today doubles down on the Wolf Administration’s commitment to encourage and support statewide legalization in Pennsylvania,\" said Jeffrey Riedy of the Lehigh Valley chapter of NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. Should employers force workers to get COVID-19 vaccine? Some experts say they should However, not everyone was on board with the governor's plans. House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff, a Republican from Centre County, was dismissive of the proposals, and questioned Wolf's motives. \"It is disingenuous for this governor to put forward an unaffordable legislative agenda and require taxpayers to bail him out of his unilateral mandates that have devastated their lives and livelihoods,\" Benninghoff said in a statement. He said a House session next week will focus on \"finding the normalcy Pennsylvanians have long desired.\" Scott Bohn, executive director of the Pennsylvania Chief of Police Association, also expressed his concerns with the governor's announcement. He said legalization of marijuana could pose significant challenges for law enforcement resulting from the unanticipated consequences it has on crime and public safety.  It is unclear how much revenue could be raised by cannabis sales. Dated estimates said the state could see hundreds of millions in taxes. Others guess the industry, which will create jobs that stretch beyond dispensaries, could have a larger impact. Wolf's past budget proposals, when he thought the state could see marijuana purchases in 2018 and 2019, put the first-year figure around $60 million and then $80 million for both medical and adult use. But obviously, the state never saw a penny from legal weed sales as lawmakers never passed a bill legalizing recreational-use marijuana.

DJI is the no. 1 manufacturer of drones, which use 3-axis motorized gimbal tools on them to smooth the action. DJI began making portable, handheld gimbals several years ago to reproduce the look on land. Gimbals are beloved by fans of smartphone video to help smooth the action and give them steadier shots.

With DJI's new design, it attempts to solve that with a new round magnet that snaps to the camera, and then back to the gimbal. DJI says the new device is smoother than previous editions because it uses \"robust motors and the absolute latest in 3-axis stabilizer technology.\" A side benefit of the snap device is that the phone is no longer locked to the cradle attachment, and there's more room on the sides to let the camera roam free. This enables attaching a microphone to a phone on a gimbal, which prior editions wouldn't allow. One new feature of last year's Osmo Mobile 3 which remains with the new version is the ability to fold it up and put it your pocket.

Conway, who has held her role as a counselor the Trump administration since the president started his term, is one of his longest-serving officials. She informed President Donald Trump on Sunday night that she would be departing at the end of the month.  Here is what to know about her time at the White House, why she's leaving and the controversies that followed her through her time helping Trump.   Conway was the first woman to lead a presidential campaign to victory in 2016, when she was Trump’s campaign manager in the final few months of the race. Before becoming a manager, Conway was already a senior adviser to the Trump campaign. She has also been a pollster and strategist in the past, having founded her own polling company in 1995. In the past, Conway has worked for former Vice President Dan Quayle, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen. Ted Cruz and Mike Pence. Conway announced late Sunday night that she would be leaving her role in the Trump administration to focus on her family. Her husband, a conservative lawyer and Trump critic George Conway, also said he is stepping back from his job with the Lincoln Project, an effort launched by Republicans to unseat Trump.  \"We disagree about plenty, but we are united on what matters most: the kids. Our four children are teens and tweens starting a new academic year, in middle school and high school, remotely from home for at least a few months,\" Conway said in a statement. 'Less drama, more mama':Kellyanne Conway leaving White House to focus on family; George Conway stepping away from Lincoln Project Kellyanne and George Conway's marriage has been the subject of attention as George Conway repeatedly feuded with his wife's boss, despite her high role within the administration. He's known for his tweets slamming the president and his policies at every turn, and has even drawn some response from Trump. Trump has tweeted that he is the \"husband from hell\" and a \"whack job.\" Kellyanne Conway has expressed frustration at the focus on her marriage in the press, once calling a Washington Examiner journalist to berate her for including mention of her husband in an article.  Enter, their 15-year-old daughter Claudia, whose TikTok videos with left-leaning views and comments about her parents have gone viral over the past couple months. Claudia has also described a turbulent situation at home, tweeting over the weekend that she is seeking emancipation from her parents. Claudia said on Twitter that she would also take a break from her social media. “No hate to my parents please,” she added. The Conways said they are leaving their jobs to focus on their four children. Kellyanne Conway is perhaps the official in the administration most dinged for potential violations of the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from taking part in partisan political activities. The Office of the Special Counsel recommended that the president fire her last year over her \"egregious, notorious and ongoing\" violations of the 1939 law, but Trump refused at the time, with the White House arguing Conway was exercising her right to free speech. She was accused of using her official capacity to speak out against 2018 midterm candidates and 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. The Republican Convention has also come under fire over the last few days for using the White House as a backdrop for some convention activities.  Convention under scrutiny:Trump criticized for using White House as a backdrop for the convention Conway was also the inventor of the now famous phrase \"alternative facts,\" which she coined in 2017. She explained that then-White House spokesperson Sean Spicer was using \"alternative facts\" to support his false claim that the crowd for Trump's swearing-in was \"the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period.\" "}, {"id": "usatoday39", "publisher": "usatoday", "label": "left-center", "title": "Mitchell's case is the only time in modern history the federal government has sought the death penalty over the objection of a tribe when the crime was committed on tribal land.", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/08/26/lezmond-mitchell-only-native-american-federal-death-row-executed/5639301002/", "section": "politics", "date": "2020-08-26-09PM", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS – Lezmond Mitchell was put to death Wednesday evening at the federal prison in Terre Haute, according to the Associated Press. Mitchell, 38, was a member of the Navajo Nation and the only Native American on death row. He was convicted of killing 63-year-old Alyce Slim, and her 9-year-old granddaughter, Tiffany Lee, in Arizona in 2001. Mitchell became the fourth prisoner to be executed in Terre Haute this year. Like the three executions before him, multiple appeals were made to stay or cancel the execution. Also like the others, the appeals were unsuccessful. On Sunday, Mitchell's attorneys asked the U.S. Supreme Court to halt his execution in a request that was denied Tuesday night. Attorneys also made one final request for clemency before President Donald Trump. More:Scheduled federal execution of Navajo man raises sovereignty concerns Attorneys said Mitchell's case is the only time in modern history the federal government has sought the death penalty over the objection of a tribe when the crime was committed on tribal land. The Navajo Nation consistently objected to Mitchell's execution. Records from the Navajo Nation and Mitchell's attorneys show that Marlene Slim, Tiffany's mother and Alyce's daughter, also objected to prosecutors pursuing the death sentence at the time of the trial. But attorneys representing Marlene as well as Tiffany's father, Daniel Lee, said in a statement on Wednesday that their clients' wishes relating to Mitchell's sentence have not been \"accurately expressed.\" Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Wednesday that members of the victims' family attended the execution. “Nearly 19 years after Lezmond Mitchell brutally ended the lives of two people, destroying the lives of many others, justice finally has been served,\" Kupec said. \"In attendance at the execution this evening were representatives of the victims’ families as well as the father of the 9-year-old girl that Mitchell murdered. Those family members, who are members of the Navajo Nation, have stated on the record that they supported implementation of the sentence returned by the jury and imposed by the court for Mitchell's horrific federal crimes.” On Oct. 28, 2001, Mitchell and Johnny Orsinger, a minor at the time, traveled from Arizona to New Mexico. Mitchell was preparing for an armed robbery, and the two decided to hitchhike back to the Navajo reservation, according to court documents. Slim and her granddaughter were traveling through New Mexico, and at some point on the trip, they picked up Mitchell and Orsinger. Slim stopped to let the men out in Arizona, but they stabbed her 33 times. Court documents said the men made the child sit next to her grandmother's body, and Mitchell drove to the mountains before ordering the girl out of the truck. Court documents said Mitchell cut the child's throat. When she did not die, Orsinger used rocks to kill her. Mitchell was sentenced to death in 2003 after being convicted of carjacking resulting in death, murder, robbery and kidnapping. Orsinger, who as a juvenile was ineligible for the death penalty, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison. Advocates across the country called on the federal government to stop Mitchell's execution because of sovereignty concerns related to the Navajo Nation. The federal government didn't have any jurisdiction on tribal land until Congress passed the Major Crimes Act in 1885. With the passing of the Major Crimes Act, the government gained jurisdiction over certain crimes committed on tribal land by a Native American against another Native American. More:Supreme Court clears way for federal executions to resume In 1994, the Federal Death Penalty Act allowed tribal governments to say if they wanted the capital punishment to be applied to their citizens. The Navajo Nation is against the death penalty and told the federal government it did not want the death penalty to be pursued in Mitchell's case. Federal executions resumed in Terre Haute in July after a 17-year hiatus. Daniel Lewis Lee was the first to be executed. Since then, Wesley Ira Purkey and Dustin Lee Honken have been executed. Another man is scheduled to be executed two days after Mitchell. Keith Dwayne Nelson was convicted of kidnapping, raping and killing a 10-year-old girl in Missouri in 2001. William Emmett LeCroy, who raped and murdered a woman in Georgia in 2001, is scheduled to be executed Sept. 22.

That includes accusing Biden of supporting the \"defund police\" mantra of protesters – even though Biden has repeatedly said he doesn't support draining funding from local police departments. More:Kenosha shooting: Juvenile arrested after 2 dead, 1 injured; federal agents to be deployed Two protesters in Kenosha were shot and killed and another was injured late Tuesday night by an apparent lone gunman. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, faces a first-degree intentional homicide charge in Kenosha County. He is now jailed in Lake County, Illinois, and has been charged there as a fugitive from justice. Biden, in his video, recounted what he said after the killing of George Floyd in May, calling protests over police brutality \"a right and absolutely necessary.\" \"But burning down communities is not protest. It's needless violence – violence that endanger lives, violence that guts businesses and shutters businesses that serve the community. That's wrong.\" The protests in Kenosha have led to buildings being burned, windows smashed out and stores looted. Biden said the \"wisest words that I've heard spoken so far\" have come from Julia Jackson, mother of Jacob Blake. \"She looked at the damage done in her community and said this, 'This doesn't reflect my son or my family. So let's unite and heal, do justice, end the violence and end systemic racism in this country. Now.\" Trump said Wednesday that Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has \"agreed to accept federal assistance,\" and that federal law enforcement and the National Guard would be sent to the city, he tweeted. FBI agents and U.S. Marshals will be deployed in response to the unrest, U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec tweeted. During a virtual roundtable Wednesday with Black women voters in Michigan, Harris also addressed the shooting   “What happened there is so tragic and still represents the two systems of justice in America,\" Harris said. \"There are still two systems of justice in America and we, we need to fight again for that ideal that says all people are supposed to be treated equally, which is still not happening.” Following Floyd's May 25 death in Minneapolis, Biden met with the George family in Houston and delivered video remarks at the funeral. Philonise Floyd, one of George Floyd's brothers, spoke at last week's DNC convention and held a moment of silence for Black victims of police shootings. Blake's death is under investigation by the Wisconsin Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation, which has said it will attempt to present its findings to prosecutors within 30 days.

Period,” Harris said. “We will continue to ensure that Israel has the unbreakable support of the United States.” The Obama administration’s nuclear deal sought to hinder Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon. But the deal was heavily criticized, with skeptics saying it was unenforceable, and Trump withdrew from it. Harris said Iran “is revving up its nuclear activity and becoming more provocative.” \"I serve on the Intelligence committee and I believe that we are more isolated than ever from our allies and that we need help for us to meet this challenge,” the California senator said. “The Trump administration took the issue of arms embargo against Iran to the (U.N.) Security Council recently and only one other country voted with us. I think it's fair to say this ‘America first’ approach has been America alone, which is not in our best interest or in the interest of our allies.” Both parties court support from Jewish Americans.

The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of three veterans and several protesters, accuses federal officers of excessive force and unlawful arrests. The Trump administration has been criticized for what many saw as an aggressive federal response to the unrest in Portland and for sending officers and agents despite opposition from local and state officials. Portland protests over racial injustice have stretched into months since the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. One of the plaintiffs is Duston Obermeyer, a Marine Corps veteran who was struck with a baton and sprayed with a chemical irritant by federal officers while he was outside the federal courthouse in Portland, according to a complaint filed Wednesday. Obermeyer and another veteran made headlines last month after they and several others formed a line of military veterans in front of a fence erected around the federal courthouse in Portland. Wall of Vets joined similar groups, such as Wall of Moms and Wall of Dads, that stood in line outside the courthouse during the protests.  George Floyd protests:Lawsuits extend fight against police brutality from streets to courtrooms Obermeyer first went to downtown Portland in mid-July after seeing news reports about the federal government's aggressive response to the unrest in Portland, according to the complaint. He said he was recording the events on his phone when he saw a group of heavily armed officers march toward a group of protesters. The officers, he said, fired tear gas toward the crowd. One officer grabbed and shoved a woman to the ground, causing her to slide about six feet, he said.  The sight upset Obermeyer, who believed the use of force was unprovoked. He began yelling questions at the officers, asking them if they understood their constitutional duties. One officer then struck him in the face and chest with a baton, he said. One pointed a weapon toward his face, and another fired a chemical irritant at him. \"I was not doing anything provocative,\" Obermeyer said. \"Even after being attacked, I didn't attack them.\" \"This country was built on the foundation that you’re allowed to assemble, you’re allowed to share ideas, you’re allowed to protest,\" He added. \"If we start taking those rights away, then we’re gonna have a real problem.\" A picture showed Obermeyer standing with his hands down as a group of officers in military fatigue sprayed chemical irritants at him. \"I can't believe this is happening in my country,\" Obermeyer said, recalling his thoughts as the incident unfolded. \"I was a Marine for 10 years. I spent a majority of my adult life training to defend this country, and I cannot believe that that just happened.\" Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf defended the federal response to the unrest in Portland during a testimony before a Senate panel earlier this month. Wolf and other administration officials have maintained that federal officers were tasked with protecting federal properties in the city.  WOLF:Feds in Portland 'are not the Gestapo' Wolf, a defendant in the lawsuit, also blamed local and state officials for failing to protect federal properties, saying officers and agents \"were abandoned\" as they were attacked by violent instigators. Officers, he said, were attacked with bricks, baseball bats, explosives and other violent weapons, and several may have had permanent eye damage.  \"Our law enforcement officers are not the Gestapo, storm troopers or thugs,\" Wolf said before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Last month, state and federal officials reached an agreement to withdraw federal agents from downtown Portland and task state troopers with protecting the courthouse. Oregon State Police pulled out its officers after two weeks, according to The Oregonian. Wolf told the Senate panel there's been a \"noticeable decrease\" in violence directed at the courthouse, although the unrest continues. He also said agents would remain in Portland. The lawsuit alleges that Obermeyer and the other plaintiffs did not provoke violence but were subjected to it. They suffered head gashes, black eyes and other injuries, according to the complaint. \"Our clients were protesting in support of Black Lives Matter, but they were met by indiscriminate violence from federal police forces intent on squelching their message and their Constitutional rights,\" said attorney Jeremy Sacks, who represents the plaintiffs.  Portland protests:Navy veteran beaten and pepper-sprayed by federal agents at protest in Portland One plaintiff, a Navy veteran, was captured in a viral video standing in a cloud of tear gas while an officer in military fatigue struck him repeatedly and another sprayed him with a chemical irritant. Christopher David, wearing a Navy sweatshirt and a hat, later walked away as he raised his middle fingers at the officers. Like Obermeyer, David was asking the officers about their constitutional duties. His right hand was broken in two places after the baton beating and his ring finger required surgery, the complaint says. Another protester, Nichol Denison, who joined the demonstration as a member of Wall of Moms, suffered a three-inch gash to her forehead after officers hurled a tear gas cannister at her, according to the complaint. Denison, an Air Force veteran, was merely standing in line when she was hit with a cannister, the complaint says."}, {"id": "usatoday43", "publisher": "usatoday", "label": "left-center", "title": "Lt.

Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, was joined by chairmen of other national security oversight committees in seeking a probe by the Pentagon Inspector General into White House retaliation against retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and his brother Yevgeny Vindman. Alexander Vindman became a key witness in the impeachment hearing, testifying that he raised concerns about Trump pressuring the president of Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden. On Wednesday, the lawmakers released details of Yevgeny Vindman's complaints to Pentagon officials about top White House staffers, including Robert O'Brien, Trump's now National Security Adviser. He alleged that last year O'Brien, then in a different position, and National Security Council Chief of Staff Alex Gray, had excluded women from meetings, made sexist and demeaning remarks to women staffers, including inappropriate comments on their looks and “talk[ing] down” to them. \"Based on this new information, it is all the more urgent that the (Department of Defense Inspector General) immediately investigate whether adverse personnel actions taken against LTC Alexander Vindman and LTC Y. Vindman were carried out in retaliation for their protected disclosures, and that your investigation include a close examination of actions taken by White House officials,\" Smith and the other chairmen wrote to acting Pentagon Inspector General Sean O'Donnell. Dwrena Allen, a spokeswoman for O'Donnell, said the inspector general had received the letter and is reviewing it. There was no immediate response from the NSC. Alexander Vindman retired Aug. 1 despite having been just promoted to the rank of colonel. He cited bullying and intimidation from the White House for leaving the Army. Yevgeny Vindman is still an Army lawyer. The lawmakers wrote on Wednesday that Yevgeny Vindman, who had been serving as an ethics and legal adviser, appeared to have suffered retaliation for raising concerns about Trump’s July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and for reporting multiple ethics and legal allegations against then-assistant to the President for National Security Affairs O’Brien and Gray. Among the abuses alleged by Yevgeny Vindman: • O'Brien used government-funded travel to Utah and California with his wife for a speaking engagement to ROTC cadets at Brigham Young University where his daughter is a cadet. Vindman had warned that the trip appeared improper and a personal conflict of interest. After complaining, Vindman was told he would no longer be charged with vetting O'Brien's engagements with private entities. • O’Brien “became agitated and angry” in September 2019 when Vindman and his colleagues advised O'Brien about conflicts of interest, including who could buy him lunch or dinner. O\"Brien \"yelled\" at Vindman because he disagreed with the rules.  • O'Brien and Gray misused official time for personal errands including scheduling haircut appointments, retrieving personal luggage and to coordinate personal dinner arrangements. • O'Brien used his position to give preferential White House access to friends. Vindman wrote to the Pentagon general counsel in March to register his concerns, the lawmakers said. \"I notified my supervisors on the NSC staff and White House Counsel’s Office about each of these concerns,\" Vindman wrote. \"To my knowledge no action was taken. Consequently, my professional obligations persist. While any of these infractions are serious, together they form a disturbing pattern of flagrant disregard for rules. I fear that if this situation persists, personnel will depart and national security will be harmed. I request you inquire into the facts and allegations herein and take appropriate action.\""}, {"id": "usatoday44", "publisher": "usatoday", "label": "left-center", "title": "Federal intelligence officials have detected \"scanning and probing\" operations targeting local election systems, officials said Wednesday.", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/26/feds-local-election-systems-probed-mail-ballot-fraud-not-seen/5633052002/", "section": "politics", "date": "2020-08-26-09PM", "body": "Federal authorities have detected \"scanning and probing\" operations targeting local election systems, but efforts to penetrate the networks have been largely unsuccessful, officials said Wednesday.  At the same time, the officials said they have \"not seen\" coordinated efforts to manipulate mail-in balloting, despite the unsupported assertions of President Donald Trump who has warned of massive fraud.

Gore eventually conceded on Dec. 13 after a 5-4 Supreme Court decision ended the recount. Gore told Reuters that he accepted the result because it was the best thing for the country.  \"It turns out there’s no intermediate step between a final Supreme Court decision and violent revolution,\" Gore said. \"It seemed to me that respect for the rule of law and respect for the needs of American democracy were the orders of the day. \"You can always explore the option of dragging something out, tearing the country apart, mobilizing partisans against one another in the streets and all of that, but it was not a wise course for our country,\" he added.

I’m a former Republican and a Never Trumper, so I understand that none of it was meant to speak to me. But none of it actually enraged me until the moment President Donald Trump seized one of the most sacred rituals of American civilization — the creation of new citizens — and exploited it for his own purposes. Before I say another word about Trump, I want to extend my congratulations to my new fellow citizens. Your addition to our nation is a joy, part of the miracle of America. Welcome home. But how sad, how wrong it was, that their first moments as citizens were spent in a White House full of people almost certainly engaged in breaking the law while their new chief executive treated them as nothing more than props in a political spectacle. While the president and vice president are not subject to the Hatch Act (the law that prohibits government employees from using their positions for political activity), everyone else in the White House surely is, and they all worked with a political party to hold a campaign event on government property using government resources. The actual oath was administered by acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, a Trump sycophant who is illegally occupying his Cabinet office. What the president did was tasteless and hollow; what Wolf did was probably illegal. And all of it was an offense to our traditions. As journalist Susan Glasser noted at that moment: “It’s like the lawyers told Trump all the partisan things that you are not supposed to do in the White House — and he said great, let’s do them all on TV during the Republican convention.” Sadly, we have become numb to the president’s many offenses, large and small, against the law and the Constitution. Trump’s people have long regarded the Hatch Act in particular with open contempt: Nearly a dozen senior Trump officials have been reprimanded for violations, but that doesn’t matter to any of them. “I honestly don’t care” about violating the Hatch Act, Lynne Patton, a Trump appointee at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said just last year. When challenged on social media, she tweeted: “What part about ‘I don’t give a sh-t’ don’t you understand?” White House chief of staff Mark Meadows continued this tradition Wednesday morning, telling Politico: “Nobody outside of the Beltway really cares” about the Hatch Act. Well, I care about the Hatch Act because I care about the law — and because it applies directly to me. I teach at a U.S. military institution, and I am considered a “less restricted” employee who can participate freely in partisan activity so long as I make clear that I do not represent the views of the government or do so on government property or with government resources. Throughout my 25 years of service, I have not found this a difficult or unfair set of requirements, and I have done my best to observe them in detail. (The article you’re reading was written on my own computer and didn’t even use the government’s electricity.) This has not stopped Trump’s most ardent supporters — the kind who likely applauded the convention’s flouting of the law — from demanding, for years, that the Hatch Act should be invoked to fire or discipline me for expressing my views. As is always the case with would-be authoritarians, such people believe that laws exist not for the common good but as tools to punish their political opponents. The Trumpist maxim, always, is the one often attributed to 1930s Peruvian military leader Oscar Benavides: “For my friends, everything; for my enemies, the law.” Billy Graham's granddaughter:Evangelical support of Trump spits on his legacy  Trump perverted the naturalization ceremony in two other ways. First, he listed the accomplishments of these citizens as though their credentials mattered. One of them was “a phenomenal success”; another spoke multiple languages; another had a Ph.D. It’s wonderful that they are people of achievement, and Trump might have meant to showcase their talents, but it sounded like the last round of a hiring panel. (“Great going,” Trump said, as if they had landed new junior executive gigs.) I felt this keenly thinking of my immigrant grandparents, who came from Ireland and Greece as people of the lowest station, broke and uneducated. America accepted them because they accepted America, not because they passed some sort of social status check. They asked for a chance. America gave them one. My daughter, born in Russia, is also an immigrant. It was among the happiest moments of my life when our plane touched down in Boston to drape a flag around the carrier of a tired and confused toddler who didn’t realize that a great nation had accepted her as its own and made her not only my child but a child as well of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. She didn’t have to pass the SAT or speak five foreign languages. (Frankly, she didn’t yet speak anything at all.) Worst of all, by making the oath of citizenship part of a partisan convention reality show with Trump as the special guest star, the president turned it into an oath not to the Constitution but to himself. Wolf, of course, played his part, turning immediately from the new citizens to Trump to thank him as though this all occurred at his sufferance. The party, it is Trump:RNC? We only see a TNC, the Trump National Convention Trump then tried to give a short speech, his usual stumbling over words he had not read. In a telling moment, he got stuck and had to ad-lib, referring to \"the rights so dear to every American” as “granted by us.” This, of course, is the very opposite of the American conception of rights. He corrected himself to say “and granted by God,” for what little it mattered. He droned on for a bit longer, and then it was over. Trump is not the first president to administer the naturalization oath. Other presidents have taken pride in this great and beloved act. But he is the first to tarnish it as the instrument of a cult of personality, and to cheapen it like everything else he has touched in his tawdry ooze through our public life.

And your tax dollars are paying for his trip to Jerusalem, where he spoke,\" the Democratic National Committee tweeted from its campaign War Room account.  \"Once again, the rules go out the window for @SecPompeo when they get in the way of serving his political interests and Donald Trump,\" tweeted House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y..

That tradition ends tonight.\"  Murphy also criticized Pompeo for claiming Trump \"held China accountable for covering up\" the coronavirus outbreak, saying that the president had praised China's handling of the virus 37 times in the early days of the pandemic.  Sen.

Activists say the term has led to increased discrimination against Asians and Asian Americans. \"We have worked so hard as a nation to make our dealings with other countries and our place of leadership in the world above politics,\" Klobuchar said. \"I want it back.\" 'It is just so wrong':Mike Pompeo under fire for speaking to RNC from Israel First lady Melania Trump, who delivered the closing speech Tuesday, was widely praised for being one of the only RNC speakers to address the lives lost to the pandemic and the racial tensions roiling the country.  But Democratic critics said her rhetoric did not match the reality of her husband's administration. Many questioned her claim that the president, whose factual distortions are well documented, \"is an authentic person,\" though she seemed to be saying he is true to his nature, rather than to facts.  \"Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president, whether you like it or not, you always know what he is thinking,\" she said.  \"Has Melania ever actually met her husband?  She seems to be describing someone else, someone very different,\" tweeted Joe Lockhart, who served as White House press secretary under President Bill Clinton.  \"This is a woman whose husband had to pay court costs this week because he paid off a porn star,\" said former Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., on MSNBC, referring to a recent California court ruling related to hush money paid to Stormy Daniels.   Critics also said her comments on race rang hollow because she had supported her husband's baseless claim that Obama, the first Black president, was not an American citizen.  \"Commentators gushing over Melania stringing a few bland words together and saying she’s sorry the people her husband killed are dead without acknowledging her complicity in a shocking breach of law and norms or her racist birtherism is the kind of normalization that got us here,\" Shaub tweeted.  \"I’m so disappointed to wake up to this fawning coverage of Melania’s speech, erasing Trump’s horrific treatment of immigrants,\" tweeted Briana Wu, director of the progressive Rebellion super PAC. \"She was a birther. She has played her own part in this horror, and media should know better by now.\"  Critics slammed White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow for referring to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in the past tense, while about 1,000 COVID-19 deaths are still being reported in the U.S. every day. \"It was awful,\" Kudlow said. \"Health and economic impacts were tragic. Hardship and heartbreak were everywhere. But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus.\" Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn., pointed out that despite Kudlow's phrasing, the outbreak is far from over.  \"White House advisor Larry Kudlow talked about the coronavirus pandemic in the past tense, as if it ended. 178k Americans have died, including over a thousand since just yesterday,\" Casey tweeted. Dr. Kavita Patel, a Brookings Institution fellow who served in the Obama administration, said \"Kudlow referring to the pandemic in the past tense sums up the national response.\"  While cases and deaths have started to decline, about 40,000 new cases are being reported in the U.S. each day and a University of Washington model that has been cited by the White House predicts the current death toll of 178,000 in the U.S. will climb to nearly 310,000 by December 1.  Kudlow also struck an upbeat tone on the economy, declaring \"Americans are going back to work\" even as the unemployment rate hovers around 10%, matching the peak level of the Great Recession.  Democrats also took issue with Kudlow's claim that Trump inherited a \"stagnant economy.\"  \"It is hard to type fast enough to respond to the economic lies at the RNC tonight. The fact is, jobs grew faster in the last three years of Obama than during the first three of Trump,\" tweeted former Labor Secretary Robert Reich.  Cissie Graham Lynch, daughter of the late Rev. Billy Graham, accused Democrats of stifling religion and toutedTrump as a champion of religious Americans.  \"Democrats pressured schools to allow boys to compete in girls' sports and use girls' locker rooms. Those are the facts,\" she said, referring to the inclusion of transgender children in sports and other activities based on their gender identities. Lynch said Trump \"withdrew policies that placed our little girls at risk.\" Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and a former Democratic presidential candidate, criticized Lynch for her comments as an \"attack\" on transgender children.  \"Truly remarkable to hear an entire speech on faith that defends discrimination and finds time to single out transgender children for attack, yet makes no mention of poverty, healing, humility, forgiveness, redemption, or mercy,\" Buttigieg tweeted. He also reminded people of when Trump held up a Bible during a photo-op outside a church near the White House just after law enforcement officials forcefully cleared anti-racism protesters from the area.  \"They would speak of faith? The choice here is so simple. One man waves a borrowed Bible around, the other actually reads it,\" Buttigieg said. Lynch also falsely claimed that Trump was the first U.S. president to defend religious liberties in a speech to the United Nations. Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush spoke on the subject at the UN, and presidents regularly stressed the importance of such freedoms during the Cold War. "}, {"id": "usatoday48", "publisher": "usatoday", "label": "left-center", "title": "Vice President Pence, who will deliver his convention speech at Baltimore's Fort McHenry, echoed Trump's optimistic view of the COVID-19 pandemic response.", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/26/mike-pence-vouch-trump-pandemic-economy-baltimore-speech/5626574002/", "section": "election", "date": "2020-08-26-09PM", "body": "WASHINGTON – Not far from the vice presidential residence in Northwest Washington is a sign designed to draw Mike Pence’s attention. “Hey Pence,” read the pink letters hand-painted onto plywood. “167,003+” The number of deaths from COVID-19, which the sign references, has grown since it was erected. Pence was put in charge of the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic that, beyond its deadly consequences for people, upended the president’s reelection campaign. Four years ago, when Trump’s candidacy was nearly blown up by the release of a video from 2005 in which he bragged about grabbing women, Pence helped stabilize the campaign by staying on the ticket. He offered his testimonial as a Christian who believes in forgiveness. He has the more difficult task of saving both their political futures by convincing the nation that Trump has the coronavirus under control, a challenge he will continue to undertake when he addresses the Republican National Convention on Wednesday. “We think there is a miracle around the corner,” Pence said on CNN during a round of television interviews after the Democratic National Convention last week. “We believe it’s very likely that we’ll have one or more vaccines for the coronavirus before the end of this year. All of that’s attributed to President Trump’s leadership.” Despite the loyalty reflected by Pence’s reflexive and constant praise for Trump, he’s had to endure never-ending speculation about whether Trump would replace him on the ticket. Could Trump attract more support from women or nonwhite voters if he ran with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem or South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott? Several people close to Pence said he’s always felt secure in his relationship with Trump. “I don’t think he was ever personally, seriously worried about that,” said John Hammond, a friend and Republican National Committee member from Indiana. Trump was asked about Pence at a White House lunch more than a year ago that David McIntosh attended as head of the conservative Club for Growth. “He just kind of listened and then said, ‘I just think it'd be disloyal for me not to have him,’\" said McIntosh, a close friend of Pence's. Pence told McIntosh afterward that Trump relayed the same message to him. “I think (Pence) was at peace, really, the whole time,” McIntosh said. Many people don’t appreciate how much of a “skilled and capable inside player” the vice president is, said Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, who has known Pence since his early days in Congress. “Sometimes people mistake the Boy Scout demeanor and the `Midwestern nice’ for not being as tough as Trump,” Reed said. “The only people who think that are people who don’t know Mike Pence.” Rising GOP stars Haley, Noem and Scott are among the speakers at the convention, as well as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and Trump’s son, Donald Jr., possible contenders for the 2024 GOP nomination. The Republicans maneuvering to reshape the GOP in a new image if Trump is defeated include former Ohio Gov. John Kasich who spoke at the Democrats’ convention. Political analyst Ramesh Ponnuru said Pence has to show he’s done everything possible to support the ticket and, if Trump loses, it’s not because of him. “Obviously, he’s tied to Trump for the future,” said Ponnuru, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who studies the future of conservatism. “So he has to make the best of that.” Impeachment inquiry:How much did Mike Pence know about pressure on Ukraine? Pence’s negative ratings have steadily risen since Trump selected him for the ticket in 2016. About half of registered voters had an unfavorable view of him in a poll by Fox News in mid-August, compared with 41% who viewed him positively. Four years ago, more voters viewed him positively than negatively, according to the Fox polls. Pence was unfamiliar to many voters when he took the stage in 2016, days after Trump’s announcement of Pence in which Trump talked more about himself than he did about his new running mate. Pence introduced himself to the nation by repeating his favorite self-description: “A Christian, a conservative and a Republican – in that order.” In that same vein, Pence quoted the Bible’s King David when he accepted the party’s nomination for vice president Monday. “Who am I and who is my family that you’ve brought us this far?” Pence said. A Christian first:How the Bible helps Pence navigate his role as Trump's vice president I'm Billy Graham's granddaughter:Evangelical support of Donald Trump spits on his legacy. In 2016, Pence’s deep roots in the Christian conservative wing of the party’s base helped “authenticate” Trump to a group that liked what he promised but had not had a relationship with him, said Marjorie Dannenfelser, head of the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List. “The Pence imprimatur meant everything at that point,” said Dannenfelser, a longtime friend of, and political advocate for, Pence. (The vice president wrote the forward for her new book, “Life is Winning.”) Research by two political scientists who studied surveys of the same voters’ opinions throughout the 2016 campaign found no uptick in support for the GOP ticket among evangelical Christians, conservatives or Midwesterners after Pence’s addition. “I think many people believe that Mike Pence persuaded them, particularly evangelicals and conservatives,” said Christopher Devine, a political scientist at the University of Dayton whose book \"Do Running Mates Matter?\" was published this spring. “But the reality is, I think, a lot of them are fooling themselves or fooling others – or some combination of the two.” Still, Devine said, there would’ve been a real cost to Trump swapping Pence for another running mate: Trump wouldn’t have lost Christian conservatives, but he would have sent a “signal of instability” about the campaign. In a fundraising solicitation last week, Trump called Pence the “perfect Vice President” and “one of the best decisions I ever made.” He singled out Pence’s work on abortion and “religious liberties” and his leadership of the Coronavirus Task Force. The latter assignment was “classic Trump,” said Joel Goldstein, a vice presidential expert at the Saint Louis University School of Law. If the coronavirus is badly handled, Pence gets blamed, he said. If all goes well, Trump gets the credit. “Trump says nice things about Pence,” Goldstein said, “but he doesn’t really support or protect Pence’s credibility in the way that other presidents have done for their vice presidents.” A former senior White House official who asked not to be named to give a candid assessment of Pence summarized his longevity this way: “Vice President Pence is handling an extremely difficult situation very well.” Pence initially drew good reviews for his task force leadership. He worked closely with governors even as Trump attacked them. He showed empathy for victims and deference to scientists such as Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. But as the Trump administration became eager for the economy to recover, Pence embraced an optimistic view that hasn't been borne out by the path the pandemic took in recent months. In April, he said the nation would “largely have this coronavirus epidemic behind us by Memorial Day.” In June, Pence declared in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that there “isn’t a coronavirus second wave.” In an ad in July from the Lincoln Project, a campaign run by Republicans opposed to Trump, Pence’s disembodied head bumps up a chart showing a rise in coronavirus cases as Pence’s praise for Trump’s handling of the health crisis replays. Asked last week whether his statements were wrong, Pence told more than one TV interviewer that everyone has been “learning along the way.” Julian Zelizer, author of “Burning Down the House: Newt Gingrich, the Fall of a Speaker, and the Rise of a New Republican Party,” described Pence as “damaged goods” with the broader public. “Everyone in the administration is hurt by their connection to the pandemic policy, and Pence was one of the people more visible from the Oval Office, from the administration, working on this,” said Zelizer, a historian at Princeton University. “The only people who survive this are figures like Fauci who are seen as outliers and voices of truth.” Pence will deliver his convention remarks at Baltimore’s Fort McHenry, the 1812 site central to the young nation’s defense against Britain that inspired Francis Scott Key to write what became the national anthem. A replica of the 15-star, 15-stripe, “Star-Spangled Banner” that Key wrote about will fly at the national monument as Pence speaks in front of an audience of mostly military families. Pence, a history buff who constantly takes notes for speeches, was still polishing his remarks at the beginning of the week. The speech is likely to have themes similar to one Pence gave in July in Ripon, Wisconsin, the city that played a crucial role in forming the Republican Party to fight slavery. Pence argued that Republicans are the party of freedom and opportunity while Democrats will usher in socialism and decline. Early marker:Pence argues against socialism in Ripon, Wisconsin “I heard the other day that democracy is on the ballot,” Pence told delegates in North Carolina on Monday. “I think we all know the economy is on the ballot. Law and order is on the ballot. Our most cherished ideals of freedom and free markets are on the ballot.” At the convention, Pence’s evolution is likely to be highlighted in an introductory video: from growing up in an Irish Catholic family and collecting news clippings of John F.  Kennedy, to casting his first vote in college – where he became a born-again Christian – for evangelical Jimmy Carter, to revering Ronald Reagan. Including footage shot from Abraham Lincoln’s boyhood home in southern Indiana, the biographical video is likely to cover Pence’s years as a radio talk show host in Indiana, which helped him hone his message as the “friendly conservative” and happy warrior.   'Put me in, coach':Second lady Karen Pence embraces bigger role on 2020 campaign trail Charlotte Pence Bond:What Vice President Mike Pence's daughter says about him After the convention, Pence will travel to Michigan and Minnesota before delivering a commencement address at Wisconsin Lutheran College. As he did in 2016, the former Indiana governor campaigns in Rust Belt swing states as if he’s “running for governor.” He seeks out local media for interviews and attempts as much retail politics as is possible in the era of social distancing. “He was an incredible emissary and an ambassador to a lot of voters in the Midwest who, I think, had some reticence about Trump that was based on stylistic issues,” Reed said. “As a son of the Midwest, Mike Pence was able to do that, and I think he'll do that again.” His trips have focused heavily on constituency groups such as law enforcement officers, farmers and Christian conservatives Dannenfelser was with Pence at an anti-abortion pregnancy clinic in Florida this month for the kickoff of the Susan B. Anthony List’s multistate campaign called “Life Wins.” “No sitting vice president or president has visited pregnancy centers, and that is the centerpiece of these visits,” she said. “It’s just going deeper.” Pence has begun preparing for the vice presidential debate Oct. 7 against Kamala Harris. Mike Pence vs. Kamala Harris:Here's where they might clash Asked to look further into the future – say 2024 – Pence demurred. “All my focus is on getting this president reelected for four more years,” Pence told Fox News on Tuesday when asked whether he’s thought about running for president. McIntosh said that when Pence was sworn in as vice president, he saw himself as a David-type fighter and leader figure from the Old Testament. But his role became more of a “Jonathan” to Trump’s David, a close friend and adviser. “Lots of people, myself included, told him, 'You need to get out there and lead on a couple things, because people are saying you don't have leadership ability,’ ” McIntosh said. “He said, 'That’s not my role right now. My role is to be there to support President Trump.’ ”"}, {"id": "usatoday49", "publisher": "usatoday", "label": "left-center", "title": "Pence's speech is likely to underscore the main themes of the convention: Lavish praise for Trump combined with harsh denunciations of Joe Biden.", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/26/rnc-what-expect-day-3-convention-mike-pence-trump/3431606001/", "section": "election", "date": "2020-08-26-09PM", "body": "WASHINGTON – Vice President Mike Pence wins the spotlight at the Republican convention on Wednesday, though he may spend much of his speech praising the star of show, President Donald Trump. Pence's remarks close the third day of the convention and are likely to underscore the main themes of the week-long confab: Lavish praise for Trump combined with harsh denunciations of challenger Joe Biden and what the Trump team has labeled \"socialist\" policies of Democrats. \"Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left,\" Pence told Republican delegates on Monday after they formally re-nominated him for the vice presidency. Previewing his acceptance speech, Pence proclaimed a Republican agenda for \"lower taxes, free market economics, secure borders, (and) right to life.\" He also said \"this party will always stand with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement.\" Trump speeches, attacks on Biden: What to expect this week at the RNC 'Most important election':Trump formally nominated for second term at RNC Pence, who succeeded Biden as vice president, wraps up a night of speeches that also features second lady Karen Pence, Republican Senate and House members, congressional candidates, Trump advisers and police officers. Trump himself is also expected to make an appearance, just as he has done every night of the convention. His acceptance speech at the White House closes the convention late Thursday night. The location of Pence's acceptance speech reflects the week-long effort by convention planners to showcase historic monuments, in this case Fort McHenry in Baltimore. The site of a famous battle between the Americans and the British in the War of 1812, the bursting bombs over Fort McHenry inspired Francis Scott Key to write the poem that came to be known as \"The Star Spangled Banner.\" The national anthem has also been a convention topic that Pence is apt to touch on. Previous speakers have criticized athletes and others who kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality and other forms of racial discrimination. The speaking schedule includes three Republican U.S. House members – Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y. – and two GOP senators, Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Joni Ernst., R-Iowa. Republican Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota will also speak. Perhaps the most prominent Trump ally on the agenda: Kellyanne Conway. The counselor to the president announced this week she was leaving the White House to spend more time with her family. Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, is also scheduled to address the convention. Other speakers include: Sister Dede Byrne, a surgeon and retired U.S. Army officer who works with the Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, and Scott Dane, executive director of the Associated Contract Loggers & Truckers of Minnesota. In terms of foreign policy, Republican delegates will also hear from Richard Grenell, the former ambassador to Germany and acting director of National Intelligence, and Keith Kellogg, who is Pence's national security adviser. The scheduled speakers include Jack Brewer, a former professional football who once said that Trump's efforts on behalf of African Americans made him \"the first Black president;\" and Clarence Henderson, an advisory board member with Black Voices for Trump. GOP congressional candidates will also be featured: Madison Cawthorn, who is running for a U.S. House seat in North Carolina; and Burgess Owens, a former professional football player who is seeking a U.S. House seat in Utah.

But Republicans Tuesday tried to portray a softer Trump, one who cares about the little guy: the lobsterman in Maine, the dairy farmer from Wisconsin, the police officer from New Mexico. \"More than any president in my lifetime, he's acknowledged the importance of farmers and agriculture,\" said Cris Peterson, a dairy farmer struggling until Trump's policies helped turn her business around. It was a shift in tone from Monday when speeches were laced with dark imagery about what might happen if Joe Biden is elected president. Still,Tuesday had its negative moments – former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi going after Biden’s integrity and Eric Trump Jr. attacking the “radical Democrats” who want to destroy the nation. RNC Live:Republicans sought to strike a hopeful tone on Day 2 of their convention But this turned into an opportunity to portray the president as possessing the one quality his critics accuse him of lacking: empathy. One of the most notable moments came during a taped appearance from the White House where he signed a pardon to Jon Ponder, founder of Hope For Prisoners, a Las Vegas-based organization that helps ex-prisoners re-enter society. \"Today, I’m filled with hope,\" said Ponder, at one point appearing to choke up. \"I have been given a second chance.\" The closing speech of the evening was delivered by first lady Melania Trump, who talked about her \"Be Best\" anti-bullying campaign, weighed in on the issue of racial unrest and said her husband has \"America .. in his heart.\" First lady Melania Trump rarely speaks publicly so her keynote address Tuesday was already going to be must-see TV. Speaking at a White House Rose Garden whose renovation she oversaw, Trump’s speech came a little over a week after Michelle Obama’s searing rebuke of President Trump during the Democratic National Convention. Melania Trump described her husband as an \"authentic person\" who loves the country and wants to make it better. The Slovenian-born first lady spoke confidently about the “freedoms and opportunities” her adopted country has afforded her, her \"Be Best\" initiative to prevent children from being bullied, and the importance of recognizing the power of women. “We must make sure women are heard and the American dream continues to thrive,” she said to a crowd of supporters who gathered to listen to her speech. She also offered her views on racial divisions in the country. “Like all of you. I have reflected on the racial unrest in our country. It is a harsh reality that we are not proud of parts of our history,” she said. The first lady urged the nation to come together, learn from one another and \"work together for a better tomorrow for everyone.” “I encourage people to focus on our future, while still learning from our past. We must remember that today we are all one community comprised of many races, religions and ethnicities. Our diverse and storied history is what makes our country strong, and yet we still have so much to learn from one another,” she said. \"I also ask people to stop the violence and looting being done in the name of justice and never make assumptions based on the color of a person's skin,” the first lady said. Melania Trump also talked about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"My deepest sympathy goes out to all of you who have lost a loved one and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering,\" she said. \"I know many people are anxious and some feel helpless. I want you to know you are not alone.\" And she praised her husband as a doer on issues including school choice, opioid addiction and race relations. The president's not a traditional politician, she said, but “he loves this country and he knows how to get things done … He demands actions and he gets results.” Two of the president's children rallied around their father Tuesday, offering remarks that sought to attract support from younger Americans and voters who backed Trump in 2016, saying their father's fight isn't over.  Tiffany Trump, a recent Georgetown Law School graduate who rarely makes public appearances, highlighted her father's criticisms of the media, censorship online and her father's \"relentless\" fighting spirit. She made a simple plea: \"I urge you to make judgement based on results and not rhetoric,\" highlighting some of his accomplishments over his first term.  \"If you tune into the media, you get one biased opinion or another,\" she said. \"Rather than allowing Americans the right to form our own beliefs, this misinformation system keeps people mentally enslaved to the ideas they deem correct. This has fostered unnecessary fear and divisiveness amongst us.\" Eric Trump, who helps manage his father's company – the Trump Organization – chronicled his father's campaign in 2016 and win. He highlighted the president's policies and culture divide between Republicans and Democrats.  \"This is the fight that we are in right now and it is a fight that only my father can win,\" he said. \"My father ran, not because he needed the job, but because he knew hardworking people across this great country were being left behind.\" Mary Trump's book:A bizarre White House dinner with Donald Trump and more moments  'He has no principles. None':Maryanne Trump Barry tears into her brother in secretly taped audio He also delivered a personal message to his father, noting that while he missed working with him each day, \"I’m damn proud to be on the front lines of this fight. I am proud of what you are doing for this country.\" Eric Trump closed by acknowledging the recent loss of Robert Trump, the president's brother. \"Dad, let’s make Uncle Robert very proud.\" The embrace of Trump by family members at the convention comes in the aftermath of a scathing tell-all book written by Trump's niece, Mary Trump, and the release of secretly recorded conversations in which Trump's sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, criticized him as a \"liar\" with \"no principles. None.\" Nick Sandmann, the Kentucky teen who became part of a social media firestorm last year when he was filmed facing off with activist Nathan Phillips outside the Lincoln Memorial, delivered a scathing review of the news media – a frequent target of the Trump. Sandmann, then 16, had taken a trip with his Covington Catholic High School class to Washington, D.C., for the Right to Life March in January 2019.  He and Phillips, who is Native American, were captured on videos that went viral in January when they stood facing each other on the National Mall. Sandmann stared at Phillips as Phillips participated in a song with other Native Americans. Twitter exploded with accusations of racism and privilege. News outlets like the Washington Post, NBC, CNN and the USA TODAY Network began reporting the story. He said the media's portrayal of footage of the incident, which showed him in a red Make America Great Again, turned him into \"the latest poster child showing why Trump is bad.\" \"What I thought was a strange encounter, quickly developed into a major news story complete with video footage,\" Sandmann said. \"My life changed forever in that one moment. The full war machine of the mainstream media revved up into attack mode. They did so without ever researching the full video of the incident; without ever investigating Mr. Philips’ motives; or without ever asking me for my side of the story.\" RNC:Trump criticized for using White House as a backdrop for the convention More:CNN confirms a settlement has been reached with Covington Catholic student Nick Sandmann After the incident, Nick sued several media outlets over their coverage of the incident, claiming they defamed him. He settled lawsuits with CNN and the Washington Post for undisclosed amounts. He has sued five other news companies, including Gannett, which owns USA TODAY.​ Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's appearance at the convention became a pivotal moment even before he spoke. His address, breaking diplomatic protocol and perhaps the State Department's own policy on engaging in partisan political activity, was delivered from Jerusalem where he highlighted the president's work and promises kept on the world stage, including moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to the city. American support for Israel is a galvanizing issue for evangelical voters, a crucial base of support for the GOP.   \"President Trump has put his America First vision into action. It may not have made him popular in every foreign capital, but it has worked,\" Pompeo said before listing off Trump's work with China, North Korea and in the Middle East over his term. Pompeo under fire:Secretary of states criticized for speaking to RNC from Israel The backlash over Pompeo's role in the convention is not likely to cease after Tuesday, even though he wasn't introduced as the secretary of state. The State Department said Pompeo was addressing the RNC in his \"personal capacity\" but his remarks revolved around policy and the very issues in which Pompeo has played a leading role.  Rep. Joaquin Castro, a top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, opened a probe into Pompeo's decision, saying he has \"a gross disregard\" for ethics rules and \"a blatant willingness to violate federal law for political gain.\" Republicans thrust faith and abortion into the spotlight Tuesday, portraying Democrats as a threat to freedom of religion.  Cissie Graham Lynch, the granddaughter of legendary evangelist Billy Graham, praised Trump's appointments of conservative judges to the federal bench and said he stood up for religious freedoms. \"Our Founders did not envision a quiet, hidden faith. They fought to ensure that voices of faith were always welcomed, not silenced. Not bullied,\" she said, saying under Democratic control, \"whether you're a baker, a florist, or a football coach, they will force the choice between being obedient to God, or to Caesar.\" Abby Johnson, an anti-abortion activist who formerly worked at Planned Parenthood, told of her time working for the women's reproductive heath care organization, telling the story of what led her to become a pro-life activist after helping with an abortion.  \"For me, abortion’s real. I know what it sounds like, what it smells like. I’ve been the perpetrator to these babies, to these women,\" she said. \"Life is a core tenet of who we are as Americans.\". Trump was expecting to get a heartfelt boost for his border security policies from the mother of a Mesa, Arizona, police officer killed by an undocumented immigrant six years ago. But Mary Ann Mendoza sent an incendiary tweet earlier Tuesday promoting a debunked, anti-Semitic conspiracy from the right-wing movement QAnon. The tweet, linking to a thread from @WarNuse, claimed that the Rothschilds, a wealthy Jewish banking family from Germany, were involved in global plots over centuries, including the sinking of the Titanic and the assassination of President John Kennedy, to prevent non-Jews from accumulating power and money. As a result of the backlash, the Trump campaign removed the video featuring Mendoza's remarks from their convention lineup shortly before it was set to air. QAnon is a baseless conspiracy theory that alleges that there is a \"deep state\" run by political elites, business leaders and Hollywood celebrities with ties to a child sex trafficking ring. In addition to claiming that \"deep state\" members are pedophiles, the theory insists that they are actively working against President Donald Trump.  The online movement started in the fall of 2017 on internet message boards, with posts from a self-proclaimed government insider who calls himself “Q.” The episode highlighted what critics describe as an unsettling relationship between Trump and QAnon. Trump last week said he didn't know much about the movement but welcomed support from its followers, adding that he heard they \"like me very much\" and \"love our country.\" Trump has praised Marjorie Taylor Greene, a GOP House candidate in Georgia who is a QAnon supporter as a “future Republican Star.\" Mendoza apologized for her tweet, saying she had not read the entire thread and it \"does not reflect my feelings or personal thoughts whatsoever.\" She founded Angel Families, an organization that advocates for tougher immigration policies.

The first lady focused much of her speech on what she described as the American spirit to overcome crisis, from COVID-19 to natural disasters. She steered widely clear of both policy arguments and political attacks on Democrat Joe Biden. “The common thread in all of these challenging situations is the unwavering resolve to help one another,” Melania Trump said in address that also touched on mental health and addiction with a weight few others have given to those issues. That softer approach was set before the first lady walked onto the podium in the historic garden that was recently renovated under her direction.  Unlike the convention’s opening night, most speakers Tuesday focused their fire on Biden’s policies – particularly his desire to roll back Trump’s tax cuts on high earners -- rather than on dark premonitions of “socialism” or the “destruction” of suburbs. “Americans are going back to work,” said Larry Kudlow, one of Trump’s top economic advisers. “There’s a housing boom. There’s an auto boom, a manufacturing boom, a consumer spending boom.” Speakers sought to tout the progress made confronting the economic crisis without offering proposals for dealing with the current dramatic increase in unemployment. Many featured speakers, including the first lady, discussed the coronavirus in broad terms, arguing that the president “would not rest” until a vaccine or therapy had approved to treat the illness.   Lara Brown, director of George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management, noted that some Republicans spoke as if COVID-19 was already in the past and the economy had already recovered. \"Both of those descriptions about the present moment and near future seem disconnected from the reality that most Americans are experiencing,\" Brown said. The Republican convention started Tuesday with a recognition of the high-profile shooting in Wisconsin of Jacob Blake, a Black man shot in the back by police in an incident that has aired for days on cable news. The convention’s opening prayer, offered by a Las Vegas minister, called for “healing and comfort” for Jacob Blake. Trump himself made two remarkable appearances: Formally pardoning Jon Ponder, a Las Vegas man who helps ex-prisoners re-enter society, and leading a naturalization ceremony for five new U.S. citizens. Both highly unusual events were criticized by Democrats as a questionable use of presidential authority during a political event. Liz Mair, a Republican strategist and Trump critic, wondered if the president delayed the pardon so that it would coincide with the convention. \"The main thing I find troubling is that Trump knew Jon Ponder, knew his story, knew of his good works, and didn’t get around to pardoning him until today,\" she said. But they also set a far different message than Trump’s usual rhetoric on immigration:  Trump’s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign, was barely raised at all. Neither were his efforts to limit legal immigration through unilateral changes to asylum and visa programs.  \"Congratulations,” Trump told the group in a video the White House released hours before it played during the convention telecast. “Great going.\" Convention speakers touted the tax cut law Trump signed in 2017, the recent agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Israel. The convention featured a video noting the number of women Trump had appointed to top jobs in the White House, including the current and previous two White House press secretaries. The night was not entirely devoid of harsh criticism of Biden. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, in particular, used her remarks to attack the former vice president's son Hunter for his business dealings in Ukraine, revisiting an argument she raised during the president’s impeachment defense.  “If they want to make this election a choice between who's been saving America and who's been swindling America, bring it on,” Bondi said. Nor did the convention’s second night go off without a hitch: Organizers had to pull a speaker from the lineup after she promoted anti-Semitic, QAnon conspiracy theory on Twitter. Mary Ann Mendoza -- an advocate for stricter immigration policies whose son was killed in accident by a driver who was an undocumented immigrant – was dropped shortly before the event got underway.  But for the most part, the convention’s second night appeared to stick to a different script. “Donald is a husband that supports me in all that I do,” first lady Melania Trump said. “We will be honored to serve this incredible country for four more years.” -- John Fritze and David Jackson First Lady Melania Trump headlined the second night of the GOP convention with a keynote address from the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, opening her remarks by acknowledging the coronavirus pandemic and the devastation and anxiety it has caused across the country.  “I want to acknowledge the fact that since March, our lives have changed drastically. The invisible enemy COVID-19 swept across our beautiful country and impacted all of us,” she said. “My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering.” “I know many people are anxious and some feel helpless. I want you to know. You are not alone,” she continued. “My husband's administration will not stop fighting until there is an effective treatment or vaccine available to everyone.” Are the trees gone?:Melania Trump did not remove cherry trees, historic roses from Rose Garden Trump’s homage to women’s suffrage and the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as part of the campaign’s wider effort to appeal to the crucial female voting bloc.

I understand what a privilege is that we have,\" she said. \"There are no words to describe how honored humbled and fortunate I am to serve our nation as your first lady.\" — Courtney Subramanian Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron slammed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as “a backwards thinker” and suggested President Donald Trump could live up to the “mandate” of Abraham Lincoln. Cameron, the state’s first Black attorney general, blasted Biden for saying during a radio interview earlier this year that African Americans who don’t vote for him “ain’t black” and warning in 2012 that Republicans would put Blacks “back in chains.” “Joe Biden is a backwards thinker in a world craving forward-looking leadership,” Cameron said. “There’s no wisdom in his record or plan, just a trail of discredited ideas and offensive statements.” Cameron, a rising star in the Republican Party, has come under criticism from activists who want his office to speed up its investigation into the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who was fatally shot by police in her Louisville apartment in March. Her death has sparked protests across the country. In his remarks at the Republican National Convention, Cameron criticized anarchists who “mindlessly tear up American cities while attacking police officers and innocent bystanders.” Republicans “recognize those who earnestly strive for peace, justice, and equality,” he said. Cameron, who was raised just a few miles from Lincoln’s birthplace in Kentucky, said the nation’s 16th president – who is also the first Republican president – believed “the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present … and we must rise to the occasion.” “I believe President Trump can meet Lincoln’s mandate, even as Joe Biden remains trapped by his party’s radicals and his own failed record,” he said — Michael Collins Speaking from Israel while traveling on official government business, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Trump has “led bold initiatives in nearly every corner of the world” to secure peace and “keep us safe and our freedoms intact.” “It may not have made him popular in every foreign capital, but it’s worked,” Pompeo said in defense of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy that has alienated traditional U.S. allies, even as Trump courted foreign adversaries. He recorded his remarks during a stop in Jerusalem, part of a four-country diplomatic mission in the region. The State Department said Pompeo was speaking in his personal capacity, not as America’s chief diplomat. But Pompeo talked about policy decisions. The successes he touted included holding China accountable “for covering up the China virus,” killing Islamic State leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, lowering the temperature with North Korea, exiting the “disastrous nuclear deal with Iran” and moving the U.S. Embassy to “this very city of God, Jerusalem, the rightful capital of the Jewish homeland.” In 2017, Trump delivered on a campaign promise to break with decades of U.S. foreign policy and move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. That decision, among other pro-Israel policies, has helped bolster Trump’s support among evangelical voters, a pivotal constituency for the GOP.   Pompeo’s remarks broke diplomatic protocol and perhaps the State Department's own policy on engaging in partisan political activity.  Before he spoke, Rep. Joaquin Castro, a top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, opened a probe into Pompeo’s decision, saying he has \"a gross disregard\" for ethics rules and \"a blatant willingness to violate federal law for political gain.\" — Maureen Groppe and Deirdre Shesgreen Eric Trump, Trump’s third eldest son, joined a list of relatives who spoke or are slated to speak at the Republican convention. He used his remarks to tick off a list of his father’s accomplishments and echoed his brother, Donald Trump Jr., in painting a Joe Biden presidency as “the empty, oppressive and radical views of the extreme left.” “He is a career politician who has never signed the front of a check and does not know the slightest thing about the American worker or the American business,” Trump said. Like his brother, Eric Trump falsely claimed that Biden wants to defund the police, a call by some on the left to shift public resources from law enforcement agencies to social programs and public safety alternatives. Biden has said he does not back defunding police and instead called for additional funding for local police forces. Eric Trump rounded out his remarks by speaking directly to his father, saying he missed “working alongside you every day but I’m damn proud to be on the front lines of this fight.” Tiffany Trump, the fourth of the president’s five children and perhaps the least visible, offered a stinging critique of the media, technology companies and even the nation’s education system for promoting what she described as “groupthink” that stands in opposition to the president. “People must recognize that our thoughts, opinions, and even the choice of who we vote for may and are being manipulated and invisibly coerced by the media and tech giants,” said Tiffany Trump, who graduated from Georgetown Law this year. “If you tune into the media, you get one biased opinion or another.” Trump’s family was heavily represented on the second night of the convention at a difficult time: The president’s brother died of an undisclosed illness Aug. 15. President Trump has also been forced to contend with a critical book written by his niece, Mary Trump, and recorded audio of sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, ripping him for “phoniness” and “lying.” There was little indication of that strife on Tuesday, though. Tiffany Trump implored Americans to see “beyond the façade – the masks – that so many other politicians employ” and she urged voters to “make your judgment based on results and not rhetoric.” — John Fritze and Courtney Subramanian Marrying two key criminal justice messages often addressed by President Donald Trump, the Republican convention on Tuesday turned to an Albuquerque police officer who adopted the baby of a woman addicted to heroin.  Ryan Holets recalled an incident in 2017 in which he approached a pregnant woman preparing to inject heroin. The woman confessed she seeking a family who would adopt her baby. \"God showed me exactly what I had to do,\" Holets said. \"Without hesitation, I told her that my family would adopt her baby.\" The story hit on several important themes for Trump: First, the president has frequently touted the importance of police in communities, even as some departments have come under criticism for high-profile deadly interactions with Black citizens. The story also spoke to an issue Trump has frequently discussed: The growth of opioid addiction in the U.S. Trump has signed several executive orders on the issue, and the administration has worked to reduce the number of opioids prescribed by doctors.   \"I hold a special place in my heart for those facing opioid addiction,\" Holets said. \"That’s why I’m enormously grateful to the president for his leadership in fighting this deadly enemy.\" — John Fritze Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez, the first Latina in that post in state history, urged voters to support President Donald Trump to put “America first” in economic policy and for religious freedom. “Let us join our president in his vow that America will never be a socialist country,” said Nunez, whose parents fled Fidel Castro’s Cuba. “He’s defended our religious freedom, stood with democratic allies like Colombia, and shown unwavering resolve while confronting tyrants in countries like Venezuela, Cuba, China and Nicaragua.” She said Trump would support law enforcement. She said he would fight to provide the best quality education by preserving school choice. “Americans have a choice,” Nunez said. “We can go down a dark road of chaos and government control, or we can choose the path of freedom and opportunity that was paved by those who sacrificed everything to preserve the American Dream for future generations.” — Bart Jansen Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds credits President Donald Trump with helping her state recover from devastating floods and storms. When 100-year floods breached nearly all levees and devastated communities along the Missouri River in Iowa, Nebraska and Missouri last year, Trump approved their request for federal aid in record time – just two days, Reynolds said. And when a storm called a derecho, with hurricane-force winds of up to 140 miles per hour, wiped out millions of acres of crops just two weeks ago, Trump approved the state’s disaster aid request in less than 24 hours, she said. Trump “had our back,” said Reynolds, a Republican and Trump supporter. “The president cut through the bureaucracy to do what needed to be done, and to do it quickly,” she said. Iowa is expected to be a key battleground state in November’s election. Trump carried the state in 2016 by nearly 9.5 percentage points. But polls show him in a tight race with Democratic challenger Joe Biden this year. Trump leads Biden by just 1.7 percentage points in the Real Clear Politics average of state polls. — Michael Collins Surprisingly, President Donald Trump's impeachment came up at the Republican convention on Tuesday. Not surprisingly, a Republican lawyer used it to attack Joe Biden. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who helped Trump with his impeachment defense, used her speech to attack Joe Biden's son Hunter for his business dealings in Ukraine. \"Joe Biden says he'll build back better,\" Bondi said at one point. \"Yeah ... build the Biden's Back Better.\" Bondi provided no evidence that Hunter Biden's business activity in Ukraine was illegal, or that Biden himself acted improperly. Democrats quickly pointed out that Trump was impeached for pressuring Ukraine into investigating Biden, despite the lack of evidence, and for threatening to withhold military aid if it did not follow through. Steve Schmidt, a former Republican and now a Trump opponent, tweeted that Bondi is \"ethically challenged,\" and \"lying about the Biden Family and repeating the talking points of Russian Intelligence Services.\" Bondi has a close relationship with Trump, first as a long-time confidant from her days as attorney general and later as one of the lawyers who defended the president during the Senate impeachment trial earlier this year. She also faced heavy criticism in 2013 when a Trump foundation sent her campaign a $25,000 check around the time her office decided not to join a New York state probe of consumer complaints against Trump University. Bondi has repeatedly said the donation had nothing to do with a decision made by independent investigators in her office not to pursue the investigation. — David Jackson The QAnon conspiracy theory made its way to the Republican National Convention Tuesday. Shortly before the second night of programming began, Mary Ann Mendoza was pulled from the RNC lineup after earlier in the day retweeting an anti-Semitic Twitter thread with ties to the QAnon conspiracy theory. Mendoza tweeted “Do yourself a favor and read this thread,” linking to a lengthy thread from a QAnon conspiracy theorist that claimed the Rothschilds, a famous Jewish family from Germany, created a plan to terrorize “goyim” — non-Jewish people — by having \"the goyim destroy each other\" and “rob the goyim of their landed properties.”  — Savannah Behrmann Larry Kudlow, the White House’s top economic adviser, says the U.S. economy is recovering from the coronavirus pandemic thanks to “a great bipartisan rescue” led by President Donald Trump. A tax hike would disrupt the recovery, he warned. The coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 178,000 Americans, has had a catastrophic impact on the U.S. economy since March. A mind-boggling 57.3 million workers have filed for unemployment over the past 22 weeks. Just two weeks ago, some 1.1 million Americans filed first-time applications for unemployment, the Labor Department said, signaling that the recovery will remain volatile. But Kudlow struck an upbeat tone in his remarks to the Republican National Convention. “Americans are going back to work,” Kudlow said. “There’s a housing boom. There’s an auto boom, a manufacturing boom, a consumer spending boom.” Looking ahead, the Trump administration is planning more tax cuts and regulatory relief for small businesses, Kudlow said. “Our economic choice is very clear,” Kudlow said. “Do you want economic health prosperity opportunity and optimism, or do you want to turn back to the dark days of stagnation recession and pessimism? There can’t be better economic policies than we’ve had in recent years.” — Michael Collins Republicans are working hard during the second night of the Republican convention to drive home a message about Democrat Joe Biden, arguing his administration would quickly increase taxes – as soon as Day 1.  \"You're coming out of a pandemic, and he wants to raise taxes?\" asked Larry Kudlow, one of President Donald Trump’s top economic advisers. \"That's crazy.\" It was a theme that was repeatedly raised throughout the evening. John Peterson, owner a metal company, said Biden is \"ready to raise taxes, crush us with regulations.\" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said that Trump is the candidate to support for voters \"who want lower taxes.\" Biden has vowed to repeal the Trump tax cuts approved early in his presidency, but for top earners -- those earning over more than $400,000 – as well as corporations. If elected, Biden would need buy in from Congress to roll back the tax cuts, a move unlikely to take place on his first day. —John Fritze Abby Johnson, an anti-abortion advocate known for turning against Planned Parenthood after working as the director of a clinic, touted President Donald Trump’s anti-abortion agenda. “For me, abortion is real. I know what it sounds like; I know what abortion smells like. Did you know abortion even had a smell? I’ve been the perpetrator to these babies, to these women,” Johnson said on Tuesday. Johnson, author of the memoir “Unplanned” that was also adapted into a film, told the story of witnessing an abortion that changed her views on the issue while wearing a “1972” pin to symbolize the year before Roe v. Wade made abortion legal. “I left the clinic, looking back only to remember why I now advocate so passionately for life,” she said. She praised Trump for appointing conservative Supreme Court justices who would be sympathetic to pro-life ideals and for withdrawing federal funds from clinics that conduct abortion referrals. “Life is a core tenet of who we are as Americans,” Johnson said. “And this election is a choice between two radical, anti-life activists, and the most pro-life president we’ve ever had. That’s something that should compel you to action.” Johnson has come under fire for a number of controversial opinions. Vice reported Tuesday that she said in a video she thinks it is “smart” for police to be “on more high alert” when interacting with her biracial son than with her white sons because “statistically, my brown son is more likely to commit a violent offense over my white sons.” Recent tweets by Johnson also show she supports head-of-household voting rights, which would only allow one representative from a household to cast their vote rather than each adult citizen. “In a Godly household, the husband would get the final say,” she said. In a tweet ahead of her RNC appearance on Tuesday, Johnson accused abortion rights activists of being scared of her speech and “scrambling to try to find anything to detract people from my message.” —Jeanine Santucci Nicholas Sandmann, the student at the center of a media storm, urged voters Tuesday to support President Donald Trump because he refuses to allow news coverage “to create a narrative instead of reporting the facts.” “I believe we must join a president who will challenge the media to return to objective journalism,” Sandmann, 18, said before putting on a red “Make America Great Again” hat. “This is worth fighting for. This is worth voting for. This is what President Donald Trump stands for.” The news coverage that focused on Sandmann unfolded in January 2019, when the northern Kentucky teenager stared at Native American elder Nathan Phillips, who played a drum. A viral video of the moment played repeatedly on cable news and was reported in newspapers. Sandmann, then a student at Covington Catholic High School, was attending a March for Life. Phillips was attending an Indigenous Peoples March. Sandmann said unfair coverage of the event changed his life forever in one moment without reporters asking for his side of the story or investigating Phillips’ motives. “What I thought was a strange encounter, quickly developed into a major news story complete with video footage,” Sandmann said of his portrayal as a smirking boy in a red hat because of Trump’s opposition to abortion. “My life changed forever in that one moment. The full war machine of the mainstream media revved up into attack mode.” Sandmann sued CNN for $275 million by claiming the network defamed him, and the Washington Post. He reached undisclosed settlements in January. In March, Sandmann sued five more outlets, including Gannett, the parent company of USA TODAY. “I learned that what was happening to me had a name. It was called being cancelled. As in annulled. As in revoked. As in made void,” Sandmann said. “Many are being fired, humiliated or even threatened. Often, the media is a willing participant. But I would not be cancelled.” — Bart Jansen Cissie Graham Lynch, the daughter of evangelist Franklin Graham and granddaughter of legendary preacher Billy Graham, hailed President Donald Trump as a “fierce advocate in the White House” for people of faith who stands up for religious freedoms that were “under attack” during the Obama administration. “Our founders did not envision a quiet, hidden faith. They fought to ensure that voices of faith were always welcomed, not silenced. Not bullied,” she said. “But during the Obama-Biden administration, these freedoms were under attack.” The president is trying to shore up support among conservative Christians and white evangelicals who helped him secure his 2016 victory, but his approval rating among religious groups has slipped in recent months. A Pew Research Center survey last month found that 59% of white evangelicals say they “very strongly” approve of Trump, down eight points from April. But the survey also found that 82% would still vote for him if the election were held in July. Graham Lynch, whose father is scheduled to speak on Thursday, said Trump-appointed judges who “respect the First Amendment,” supported religious beliefs in court and “ensured religious ministries would not be forced to violate their beliefs.” She added there was “no room for people of faith” in the Biden administration, though the former vice president has frequently talked about how his Catholic faith has helped him survive the death of his first wife and their daughter in a 1972 car crash, as well as the death of his son in 2015. “Whether you’re a baker, a florist or a football coach, they will force the choice between being obedient to God or to Caesar,” she said. “Because the radical left’s god is government power.” Graham Lynch’s comments came hours after Jerushah Duford, another granddaughter of Billy Graham, penned a searing rebuke of Trump and her uncle Franklin Graham for his support of the president. Duford, who wrote in USA TODAY that her faith and church have become “a laughing stock,” called on evangelical Christian women to speak out against Trump’s actions. — Courtney Subramanian  Breaking with the dire messaging of \"socialism\" and \"Loch Ness\" monsters that dominated the first night of the RNC, Republicans embraced a softer tone Tuesday -- at least in the early minutes -- ahead of first lady Melania Trump's address.   \"He has followed through on his promises,\" asserted Maine lobsterman Jason Joyce. \"More than any president in my lifetime, he's acknowledged the importance of farmers and agriculture,\" said dairy farmer Chris Peterson. In the most notable example of the shift, Trump appeared himself briefly in a taped appearance from the White House and signed a pardon to Jon Ponder, founder of Hope For Prisoners, a Las Vegas-based organization that helps ex-prisoners re-enter society. The event drew scrutiny from Democrats, some of whom questioned the president's use of an official act at a political convention, but it nevertheless underscored more of a focus on the president's accomplishments rather than on what Republicans see as Biden's failures.  \"Today, I’m filled with hope,\" Ponder said. \"I have been given a second chance.\" — John Fritze  Jason Joyce, an eighth-generation lobsterman from Swan’s Island, Maine, said he didn't support President Donald Trump in 2016 because he expected the president \"to flip flop on his campaign promises.\" But Joyce strongly supports Trump’s reelection this year because the president listened to fishermen’s views and adopted them. In contrast, Joyce characterized the Obama administration and former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, as ignoring industry views. “As long as Trump is president, fishing families like mine will have a voice,” Joyce said. “But if Biden wins, he’ll be controlled by the environmental extremists who want to circumvent longstanding rules and impose radical changes that hurt our coastal communities.” Trump has promoted Maine lobster since a June 5 roundtable in Bangor. He reversed the Obama administration order that closed off 5,000 square miles of ocean to fishing for what is called the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. “This action was deeply unfair to Maine lobstermen,” Trump said. The monument is about 130 miles southeast of Cape Cod – too far for Mainers to reach. And Obama grandfathered lobster and crab harvesting for seven years in the 2016 order, so those fisheries haven't been affected yet. But the decision still rankled fishermen. “Although Maine's lobstermen don't fish there, Obama's executive order offended us greatly. It circumvented the fisheries counsels’ input,” Joyce said. “President Trump reversed that decision, reinstating the rules that allow stakeholder input, and he supports a process that seeks and respects fishermen's views.” Lobster is a valuable seafood market, with 133 million pounds landed in 2017 worth nearly $600 million, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. Mainers landed more than 80% of the U.S. lobster catch that year. But trade wars have damaged the industry. The European Union agreed Friday to lift tariffs of 8% on U.S. lobster and 20% on lobster products, which had hurt trade compared to Canadian lobster that faced no tariffs. China also imposed a tariff on U.S. lobster in 2018 that now stands at least at 35%. Trump asked the Agriculture Department for monthly reports on the China tariff starting Aug. 15. Joyce said he strongly supported Trump's reelection. \"When he sees something isn't right, he’s fearless in fixing it,\" Joyce said. \"He listens to working people.\" — Bart Jansen Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican known for his anti-interventionist view of global affairs, praised Trump’s approach to “end war rather than start one,\" trying to portray a stark contrast between the president and Joe Biden when it comes to making the planet safer. \"I fear Biden will choose war again. He supported the war in Serbia, Syria, Libya. Joe Biden will continue to spill our blood and treasure. President Trump will bring our heroes home,\" said Paul, who has often joined the president in calling for the wind-down of U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. \"If you hate war like I hate war…if you want us to quit sending $50 billion every year to Afghanistan to build their roads and bridges instead of building them here at home, you need to support President Trump for another term.\" Trump has touted his unconventional strategy on foreign policy, including efforts to build bridges with authoritarian figures such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea despot Kim Jong-Un. He’s also drawn bipartisan fire for trying to undermine the NATO alliance and for pulling troops out of Syria, a move that prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis. Paul, who did not appear at the RNC in 2016, had some unkind words for Trump four years ago when both were running for the White House. He called the billionaire businessman \"a delusional narcissist and an orange-faced windbag.\" Trump in turn criticized Paul's looks and called him \"a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain.\" — Ledyard King Norma Urrabazo from the International Church of Las Vegas opened Tuesday’s events with a prayer for “healing and comfort” for Jacob Blake, the Wisconsin man who was shot multiple times in the back by police officers Sunday while he was leaning into an SUV.  “I’m going to invite you to join your faith with mine and let’s prayer in agreement,” Urrabazo said. “Lord, we come before you to ask for your spirit of peace to come over hurting communities in Wisconsin tonight.” In addition to prayer for Blake and his family, Urrabazo asked for protection for those who have “put their lives in harm’s way, to bring safety and security to our streets.” - Maureen Groppe Native Americans will make up a tiny slice of the electorate in November, but they could have an outsized influence on the election where it counts: Several battleground states. So it was no surprise the RNC opened its second night with Myron Lizer, vice president of the Navajo Nation – a territory that covers portions of Utah, New Mexico and Arizona. “Our people have never been invited into the American Dream,” said Lizer, who appeared with Trump at an event in Phoenix this year. “We’ve for years fought congressional battles with past congressmen and senators that were part of a broken system that ignored us. “That is, until President Trump took office,” he said.  Lizer pointed specifically to billions of dollars in economic stimulus to help tribal communities address COVID-19. Trump has had a complicated relationship with Native Americans. He repeated use of the word “Pocahontas” to mock Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been offensive to some. More recently, Trump slammed the decision to change the name of the Washington, D.C., NFL team, a word that is a slur used to describe Native Americans. According to the 2010 Census, 5.2 million people identified as American Indian and Alaska Native alone, or in combination with at least one other race. The vast majority vote Democratic, except in states where energy is a large focus of the regional economy, such as Alaska, North Dakota or Oklahoma.  Native Americans could also be a factor in Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. —John Fritze and Ledyard King President Donald Trump used a \"surprise appearance\" at Tuesday's Republican political convention to swear in five new U.S. citizens. While some analysts questioned Trump taking official actions at a political convention, the president supervised the swearing-in of five new U.S. citizens born in Bolivia, Lebanon, India, Ghana and Sudan. \"Congratulations – great going,\" Trump told the group in a video that the White House released hours before it played during the convention telecast. Noting that one of the new American citizens has a degree in psychology, Trump said: \"In other words, she can figure me out.\" While Trump used the ceremony to tout the virtues of legal immigration, Democrats said his crackdowns at the border are designed to keep out any person of color. Critics said Trump should not make such political use of the presidency at a political convention. Ben Rhodes, a foreign policy adviser to President Barack Obama, tweeted that the GOP meeting \"is infused with the illegal and unethical use of everything from the White House to the presidential pardon power.\" Before the immigration ceremony, Trump signed a federal pardon for Jon Ponder, founder of Hope For Prisoners, a Las Vegas-based organization that helps ex-prisoners re-enter society. \"Jon's life is a beautiful testament to the power of redemption,\" Trump said The state of Nevada had already granted clemency to Ponder, a convicted bank robber. Trump, who has made criminal justice reform a part of his agenda, praised Ponder's work with ex-prisoners, he did not mention voting rights. The president has opposed restoring voting rights for felons, and criticized governors who support the idea.  In thanking Trump for his federal pardon, Ponder said \"we live in a nation of second chances.\" Richard Beasley, a retired FBI agent who once arrested Ponder but is now a friend, also appeared in the video, saying, \"I'm so proud of Jon with his life's turnaround, and for all the lives that he's helped to change.\" Critics said Trump's use of the presidency violates at least the spirit of the Hatch Act that forbids government employees engaging political activity. (Presidents, however, are exempt from the law.) \"The Hatch Act is a law designed to separate politics from public service,\" tweeted Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to President Barack Obama. \"Those lines are being erased tonight.\" In his latest break from political tradition, Trump is making appearances every night at the Republican convention. That will include his formal acceptance speech on Thursday night. Location: The White House. — David Jackson  The first night of the Republican National Convention on Monday averaged 15.9 million television viewers – 29% less than viewership four years ago and 15% less than the first night of last week’s Democratic National Convention. It closely resembles the 27% nosedive in viewers for night 1 of the DNC convention, which averaged 18.7 million viewers. The opening night of the 2016 RNC convention in Cleveland, Ohio drew about 22.5 million viewers. The Nielsen figures, reported by Variety and the Los Angeles Times, combine viewership on the three main networks, ABC, CBS and NBC, and leading cable new networks CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. Fox News set the pace Monday leading with 7.1 million viewers followed by CNN’s 2 million viewers; ABC, nearly 2 million; NBC, 1.7 million; MSNBC, 1,6 million; and CBS, 1.5 million. Facing challenges of a global pandemic, both conventions ditched arenas and live audiences in favor of many recorded speeches and prepackaged videos. Democrats pieced together four nights of two-hour television shows while several Republican speakers shared the same stage at Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C. while President Donald Trump was featured in multiple videos shot in the White House. Although last week’s DNC viewership was down significantly, the campaign for Democratic nominee Joe Biden touted a record 10.2 million digital viewers, totaling 28.9 million viewers overall when combined with television viewership. — Joey Garrison On its second night, the Republican National Convention will get personal. The virtual lineup for Tuesday includes first lady Melania Trump and two of the president's children – Eric and Tiffany – along with a series of business people, advocates for Republican causes and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  Melania Trump, rarely seen campaigning with the president, will be the big draw of the evening. The first lady will speak in prime time from the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, a project she supervised.  President Donald Trump himself is also expected to show up during the online convention Tuesday. He plans to appear every night this week, leading up to his formal acceptance speech on Thursday night, also at the White House. – David Jackson  The battle over who gets credit for the pre-COVID economic recovery has become a defining issue of the conventions as well as this year's presidential election. Not surprisingly, Democrats argued Tuesday that Joe Biden deserves much of the credit.  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, speaking as part of the Biden campaign's RNC counter-programming, said it was the Obama-Biden administration that led the country out of the worst economic downturn in generations. Trump, she said, drove that progress into the ground through his trade wars and haphazard pandemic response.   “Donald Trump has severely worsened our country’s economy,” Whitmer said. “Workers and families cannot afford four more of years of that.” Trump and other Republicans have argued that the recovery under Obama, who signed a major economic stimulus in 2009, was one of the slowest in the nation's history. While unemployment and market indicators were improving under Obama, they note those numbers took off at a faster rate once Trump was in the White House.  The debate is important because both candidates are positioning themselves as best able to help the nation recover from the economic catastrophe caused by COVID-19.  Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., cited figures about how 1.5 million fewer jobs were created during the first three years of the Trump administration, compared to the final three years of the Obama administration. Booker also slammed Trump's tax cut bill as benefiting the rich while racking up enormous federal budget deficits.  “We know people all across New Jersey are hurting and need some relief,” Booker said. “Working families know that the president isn’t looking out for them.” – Bart Jansen and John Fritze"}, {"id": "usatoday53", "publisher": "usatoday", "label": "left-center", "title": "The Covington Catholic graduate in 2019 found himself in the middle of a nationwide controversy after a video of him went viral", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/25/nick-sandmann-speak-tonight-republican-national-convention/3440520001/", "section": "election", "date": "2020-08-26-09PM", "body": "CINCINNATI – Covington Catholic High School graduate Nick Sandmann Tuesday night stood before the Lincoln Memorial and introduced himself to the nation.  \"Good evening everyone. My name is Nick Sandmann, and I'm the teenager who was defamed by the media,\" Sandmann said as he opened his remarks at the Republican National Convention.  Sandmann in 2019 found himself in the middle of a nationwide controversy after a video of him and a Native American elder facing each other in a crowd went viral.  Tuesday night before a national audience, Sandmann recounted that fateful confrontation and lambasted the media for its coverage. \"How could I have possibly imagined the simple act of putting on that red hat would unleash hate from the left and make myself the target of network and cable news networks nationwide,\" Sandmann said.  An opening montage Tuesday night prior to Sandmann's remarks recapped the January 2019 incident that made Sandmann famous. It included clips from comedians Bill Maher, Trevor Noah and other commentators mocking Sandmann.  Sandmann had been on a trip with Covington Catholic classmates for the March for Life on Jan. 18, 2019. Then video circulated online showing Sandmann wearing a red Make America Great Hat and facing Native American elder Nathan Phillips in a crowd in front of the Lincoln Memorial. Phillips beat a drum in front of Sandmann.  Twitter exploded with accusations of racism and privilege. News outlets like the Washington Post, NBC, CNN and The Enquirer all began reporting the story. Sandmann said he bought his MAGA hat earlier in the day. He said his only thoughts during the confrontation was to not agitate Phillips and to not embarrass his family, friends and school. He said he kept his hands behind his back. He described his smile seen in the video as \"awkward.\" \"What I thought was a strange encounter quickly developed into a major news story complete with video footage,\" Sandmann said. \"My life changed forever in that one moment.\" He accused the media of pushing an \"anti-Christian, anti-conservative, anti-Donald Trump narrative.\" \"If advancing their narrative ruined the reputation and future of a teenager from Covington, Ky., well so be it,\" Sandmann said. \"That would teach him not to wear a MAGA hat.” He decried \"cancel culture.\" \"I would not be canceled,\" he declared. Sandmann filed suit against media organizations he claimed defamed him. He settled lawsuits with CNN and the Washington Post for undisclosed amounts. He has sued five other news companies, including Gannett, which owns The Enquirer. He ended the speech by expressing for Trump. \"No one in this country has been a victim of unfair media coverage more than President Donald Trump,\" Sandmann said.  Then he donned a red MAGA hat as his speech ended.  The Republicans have invited several non-politicians to speak at the convention. The McCloskey's, who brandished guns as Black Lives Matter protesters passed by their St. Louis home in June, spoke on Monday night. "}, {"id": "usatoday54", "publisher": "usatoday", "label": "left-center", "title": "Previous presidents have avoided blurring the line between campaign-style events, such as party conventions, with the official business of governing from the White House.", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/25/rnc-white-house-convention-speeches-ethics-hatch-act-trump/5628864002/", "section": "election", "date": "2020-08-26-09PM", "body": "WASHINGTON – Watching the Republican National Convention? Then you've already seen quite a bit of the White House, and there's more on the way. President Donald Trump will formally accept the Republican nomination Thursday from the South Lawn, where a stage was being constructed over the weekend. The first lady is set to deliver her remarks Tuesday night from the newly renovated Rose Garden. And Trump is making \"surprise\" appearances, with guests, from inside the White House during the convention. The use of the White House as a convention backdrop is unconventional and comes as Trump and the RNC scrambled to finalize details amid cancellations and COVID-19. Previous presidents have avoided blurring the line between campaign-style events, such as party conventions, with the official business of governing from the White House. Now, questions are bubbling about the propriety of the arrangement. RNC night one: Democrat Vernon Jones says Biden is 'all talk and no action' White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows defended Trump's decision to deliver his convention address from the White House, saying Monday it is necessary during the \"unprecedented time” as the country battles the COVID-19 pandemic.  He also stated the venue choice was purposeful, noting Trump is \"willing to travel everywhere\" but that the background of the White House matches the message the president wishes to send to voters. “No, it's not about convenience,\" Meadows said. \"I think it's about for most people wanting to understand and hear from the President of the United States on what he's going to do to make sure the next four years continue to build on the last four years.” Still, government watchdog groups and others worry that even the appearance of a political event at the White House raises concerns about ethical conflicts. Trump giving his acceptance speech at the White House has raised questions about the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a 1939 law that restricts federal employees' engagement in specific partisan political activities, with the aim of preventing members of the executive branch from interfering in elections. These prohibited activities include running for office, hosting fundraisers, making campaign speeches or distributing campaign materials. Courting young voters:GOP activist Charlie Kirk calls Trump the 'bodyguard of western civilization' After concerns were raised following the announcement of the speech location, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel said in a letter that Trump could deliver his RNC speech from the White House because \"the President and Vice President are not covered by any of the provisions of the Hatch Act.\"  But White House employees technically would not be able to assist in the address, with the letter explaining they \"are covered by the Hatch Act, so there may be Hatch Act implications for those employees, depending on their level of involvement with the event and their position in the White House.\"  Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said the White House would be careful to abide by the Hatch Act, saying “RNC convention events will be planned and executed, at whatever the venue, by the Trump campaign and RNC.”  “Any government employees who may participate will do so in compliance with the Hatch Act,” he said. Republicans are arguing that the speech on the South Lawn may avoid the part of the Hatch Act's provision that prohibits partisan activities in federal buildings, as they interpret that location as part of the president's residence. This won't be the first time a sitting president has used the White House to accept a party's nomination. In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his acceptance speech from the White House via radio to the Democratic convention that nominated him for an unprecedented third term. Trump also used several rooms of the White House as the backdrop for a few round-table segments during the RNC on Monday. While it was widely reported that Trump would be accepting the nomination from the White House, several clips from the first night of the convention were also filmed in the White House.  Critics had questioned whether Trump would be breaking the law if government employees assisted in the convention – and that concern was amplified Monday.  More:Former RNC chairman Michael Steele joins Lincoln Project, anti-Trump group working to elect Joe Biden MSNBC host Joy Reid tweeted, \"No masks in site at this 'frontline workers' meetup with Trump, using the White House as a set. I don’t even know where to begin.\" Jonathan Ladd, an associate professor from Georgetown, posted, \"It's still illegal under the Hatch Act for any White House staffer to participate in executing a campaign photo op/video segment in the White House.\" \"The law still matters. It should be enforced,\" he concluded. GOP this election:The prominent Republicans not supporting Trump, and those who are supporting Biden Former GOP Pennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent, who endorsed Democratic nominee Joe Biden, tweeted the White House shouldn't be used \"for campaign purposes. The location of the president's acceptance address will be just one of the ways the RNC will break with political norms, with First Lady Melania Trump also giving an address from the Rose Garden on Tuesday. First lady speech:Melania Trump unveils newly renovated White House Rose Garden, where she'll make RNC speech Even Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will join virtually to endorse the president from a location in Jerusalem, a speechthat may violate State Department policy. In an email obtained by Politico, the State Department's Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun highlighted the agency's limits on engaging in partisan political activity, says that “Senate-confirmed Presidential appointees may not even attend a political party convention or convention-related event.”  Other Hatch Act concerns have arisen over the speeches of Trump advisers Kellyanne Conway and Ivanka Trump.  The White House stated Ivanka will be speaking in her “personal capacity.”  'It is just so wrong': Mike Pompeo under fire for speaking to RNC from Israel Trump’s daughter and the other senior officials who speak at the RNC are subject to the Hatch Act’s civil statues. The White House has defended their involvement. Questions again emerged after the White House was used as a background for pre-taped \"surprise appearances\" from Trump to swear in five new U.S. citizens and to pardon Jon Ponder. Those two instances — which were filmed and later aired at the RNC — drew scrutiny from Democrats, some of whom questioned the president's use of an official act at a political convention. Others also raised concerns over the appearance of Trump cabinet member, acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf, who conducted the naturalization ceremony for new citizens filmed for the political event. More:Trump makes 'surprise' appearance during RNC to take part in the swearing-in of new citizens The coronavirus pandemic forced the RNC to select a new venue for Trump to deliver his speech. Republicans had initially chose Charlotte, North Carolina, for their convention but then shifted to Jacksonville, Florida, for the event's highest-profile speeches.  Trump then canceled the events scheduled in Jacksonville, as coronavirus cases spiked there. He had also floated delivering the speech at the Gettysburg battlefield in Pennsylvania before choosing the White House. Trump, and members of his administration and family, have faced ethical concerns before for using the power of the office promote private interests. Last month, both Ivanka Trump and the president faced questions over potential violation of White House ethics rules as a result of a social media post that promoted Goya Foods, whose CEO had praised Trump. Additionally, the Office of Special Counsel found that Conway was a \"repeat offender\" who had committed \"egregious, notorious and ongoing\" Hatch Act violations by disparaging Democratic presidential candidates.

President Donald Trump has claimed he doesn't know much about the right-wing conspiracy theory but offered praise for its believers, adding that he heard they \"like me very much\" and \"love our country.\"  The once fringe movement has led to some violent incidents, while social media platforms including Twitter and Facebook have taken action to suspend accounts and groups associated with QAnon.

The group says that at least 14 candidates that will be on voters' ballots in November have endorsed, given credence to or promoted QAnon beliefs. Greene's tweet Tuesday included a picture of the invitation, hundreds of which have been sent to allies of the president's campaign and administration.  She has made headlines several times for Islamophobic and anti-Semitic comments, as well as for claims that Black people aren't discriminated against. She has also amplified theories from QAnon, a group the FBI labeled a domestic terrorism threat last year.

But, on top of inviting Greene to the White House, Trump has amplified accounts promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory at least 216 times, according to Media Matters for America, a progressive watchdog group.  The Washington Post reported this month that the Trump campaign has been courting QAnon followers more explicitly.

Earlier Tuesday, Missouri election officials announced West will not be a presidential candidate in that state this fall. Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft said the rapper failed to gather enough signatures on his petition to appear as an independent candidate. State law requires 10,000 signatures; West turned in 6,557. The singer also missed a Monday deadline to submit signatures to get on the presidential ballot in his home state of Wyoming. West announced his bid for the White House last month and has had help in filing for office from various Republican operators and supporters of President Donald Trump. That help has led to speculation and concern that West's run is an attempt to boost Trump by luring votes that would otherwise go to Democratic nominee Joe Biden. It hasn't always worked, though. The Wisconsin elections board ruled last week that West filed too late to be on their state's ballot. In Wyoming, where West has owned a ranch in the Cody area since last year, his campaign West needed to turn in 4,025 verifiable signatures of registered voters, but by Monday’s close-of-business deadline had not submitted any, secretary of state’s office spokesman Will Dinneen said.

As of 5 p.m. EST, Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker put the number of global cases at 24,007,049. The next milestone will be a big one: 25 million. The U.S. leads the world in cases by a long shot with 5.8 million. Brazil is in second place with nearly 3.7 million, followed by India with 3.2 million. Then comes Russia, which is yet to break the 1 million mark. The only European nation in the top 10 is Spain, in a ninth place. The number of global deaths due to the virus is 821,933, Johns Hopkins says, with the U.S. also leading among countries. The Justice Department said Wednesday it is asking some governors for data on nursing home deaths related to the coronavirus. The order only applies to states where governors where the Justice Department deems that they may have resulted in needless deaths. It cited New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Michigan as having had policies that required nursing homes to admit COVID-19 patients.  “Protecting the rights of some of society’s most vulnerable members, including elderly nursing home residents, is one of our country’s most important obligations,” said Eric Dreiband,  assistant attorney general for Civil Rights Division, in a statement. “We must ensure they are adequately cared for with dignity and respect and not unnecessarily put at risk.” The department's Civil Rights Division is evaluating whether to initiate investigations under the federal “Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act,\" which protects the civil rights of persons in state-run nursing homes, among others. Though the number of Americans testing positive for the coronavirus may be ebbing in some cities, the economic damage drags on. \"Though we are seeing a meaningful decline in new COVID-19 cases, the trends in economic indicators have not changed significantly,'' BofA Global Research said in an investors note. About 1 million workers filed initial applications for unemployment insurance last week, economists estimate, a slight dip from the 1.1 million who applied the week before.  The number seeking unemployment aid for the first time has been volatile, slightly dipping and rising, yet remaining stubbornly high — far above the previous record of 695,000 weekly claims set during an economic downturn in 1982.  The see-sawing numbers reflect the stops and starts occurring throughout the U.S. economy, as businesses gradually reopen in some parts, while others roll back or halt re-openings as COVID-19 cases spike. —Charisse Jones In response to CDC guidelines that say people exposed to the virus may not need to be tested, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said scientists urge more testing at 3 million per day to identify, track and treat the virus. But a top CDC official defended the changes as \"appropriate.\" “The CDC guidelines that they have put forth are scary and dangerous,” Pelosi said in a Democratic National Convention Zoom call. “It really is very sad and just reinforces the lack of attention and understanding that we have to have in order to crush this virus.\" At a news conference, however, Dr. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services, said that the guidance is meant to encourage more \"appropriate testing, not less testing.\"  \"There will be more asymptomatic testing in areas where it's needed and less where it's not needed,\" he said. Pelosi wasn't buying it. She said the updated guidelines will be investigated by the House Energy and Commerce Committee and at the select committee headed by Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C. “This has to be resisted,” Pelosi said. “This is just again ignoring science and letting the virus have its way with our people. It really must be addressed.” – Bart Jansen Gov. Tom Wolf is calling on the Pennsylvania legislature to legalize recreational marijuana and use the tax revenue to help small businesses that have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic has steered Pennsylvania’s economy into a recession. And although programs such as the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and the Paycheck Protection Program have helped some, Wolf said, more needs to be done. \"The legislature can act right now to get us back on track as quickly as we possibly can,\" Wolf said at a news conference Tuesday.  He wants to see more money provided to front-line workers and working parents, as well as more grants created to support small businesses. These efforts could be funded, he said, with the $1.3 billion it has left from federal coronavirus stimulus relief and from the revenue from legalization of recreational marijuana. – Sam Ruland, York Daily Record Biotech company Moderna announced that a small study of its potential vaccine shows it's as safe and apparently effective in older adults as in younger ones.  The company had released data on 15 younger adults, showing a 100-microgram dose appeared safe and triggered an immune response similar to people who had been infected with the coronavirus. The new data, which has not yet been published or scientifically reviewed, shows similar results among 10 adults between the ages of 56 and 70 and another 10 older than 71. There had been some question about whether Moderna’s vaccine technology, which has never been used for an approved vaccine, would be as effective in older people, who are far more vulnerable to serious cases of COVID-19.  The company is pursuing larger trials to examine safety and effectiveness of its candidate vaccine, now called mRNA-1273. In a Phase 2 trial, the company has tested 300 younger adults and 250 over age 50. It has not released those results.  Moderna has also begun a Phase 3 trial, intending to give 15,000 people mRNA-1273 and another 15,000 a placebo. – Karen Weintraub Infectious disease experts are not only confused, but also troubled, by the recent change in testing guidelines made by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which said people without symptoms “do not necessarily need a test” – even if they’ve been exposed to the coronavirus. “Our work on the ‘silent’ spread underscored the importance of testing people who have been exposed to COVID-19 regardless of symptoms,” tweeted Alison Galvani, director for the Center for Infectious Disease Modeling and Analysis at Yale School of Medicine. “This change in policy will kill.” The CDC estimates in its COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios that 40% of infections are asymptomatic and 50% of transmission occur before symptoms appear. Experts worry that failing to test asymptomatic carriers could not only result in more infections but also hinder contact tracing efforts. “If being in close personal contact with an infected person… isn’t sufficiently important enough to get tested, I don’t see that there’s any value in contact tracing,” said Peter Pitts, president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest. Before changes were made Monday, the CDC website previously said that testing was recommended “for all close contacts of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection.” – Adrianna Rodriguez Two patients in Europe have been reinfected with COVID-19, further emphasizing the necessity of a vaccine as opposed to relying on herd immunity. Both cases – one in the Netherlands, the other in Belgium – were reported by state broadcasters and were proven to be different strains of the virus, reported Reuters. The Dutch woman, Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans told broadcasters, had a weakened immune system. “That someone would pop up with a reinfection, it doesn’t make me nervous,” Koopmans said, per Reuters. “We have to see whether it happens often.” The news comes only days after researchers at the University of Hong Kong announced that a 33-year-old man was re-infected by a different strain of COVID-19 more than four months after his initial infection.  After one week of in-person instruction, the University of Alabama has amassed 531 cases, putting the upcoming fall semester \"in serious jeopardy,\" according to Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox. “As mayor, my first responsibility is to protect the health, safety and welfare of this community and of every person that is living here, studying here or working here.” In order to curb cases in the area, Maddox ordered the shutdown of bars — both standalone and in restaurants — that went into effect Monday. The university is also limiting students' activities on campus to address on-campus hot spots.  – Gary Cosby Jr., The Tuscaloosa News New genetic data helps tell the story of how COVID-19 arrived in Massachusetts, exploded across a hotel conference center, wormed its way into a nursing home, repeatedly struck a homeless shelter, and contributed to the virus' march around the globe. Although parts of the story have already been told and others remain elusive, genetic data from many of the COVID-19 infections in the Boston area in March and April helps fill some gaps. The new research also tracks several \"superspreading events\" that may help public officials decide which activities are safe and which are dangerous, said Dr. Jacob Lemieux, who helped lead the study, which was posted online Tuesday but has not yet undergone scientific peer review.  One of the \"superspreading\" events took place in late February at a conference of the biotech company Biogen, which specializes in treating neurological diseases. – Karen Weintraub After the Food and Drug Administration offered shaky data to justify its approval of blood plasma to treat COVID-19, some scientists are worried the agency could bow to pressure to approve a coronavirus vaccine before it's fully tested. Sunday, President Donald Trump announced the FDA had issued an Emergency Use Authorization for blood plasma. The president, the Health and Human Services Secretary and the head of the FDA all said the treatment reduced deaths in COVID-19 patients by 35%. It did not, and scientists immediately questioned FDA’s claims about the data. “You saw FDA be bullied by the president of the United States into approving something that they didn’t want to approve earlier, because he wanted them to do that,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, in an online interview Monday with the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association.  — Elizabeth Weise Hawaii’s most populous island is returning to a stay-at-home order while officials strive to conduct 70,000 COVID-19 tests in two weeks amid a surge in cases. Oahu, where Honolulu is located, has seen daily triple-digit positive cases in recent weeks, an alarming spike after Hawaii had enjoyed the lowest infection rates in the nation per capita earlier in the pandemic. With help from the federal government, Oahu officials will conduct mass testing across the island with the goal of testing 5,000 people daily for two weeks, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell announced Tuesday. The tests will be free and no symptoms, health insurance or doctor referral will be needed, Honolulu Fire Chief Manuel Neves said. Starting Thursday, Oahu will be under a stay-at-home order with gyms and dine-in restaurants to be closed. Religious services will be allowed to continue. So-called essential businesses such as grocery stores, banks and childcare facilities can remain open. Most schools have been providing online instruction. The nation's county with the highest number of COVID-19 infections is seeing a decline in confirmed cases. The Los Angeles County Public Health Department confirmed 989 new infections Tuesday, marking the first time it has reported less than 1,000 daily cases since the beginning of June. The number of daily confirmed cases from mid to late July was about 3,200, officials said. However, Los Angeles County remains on California's coronavirus watchlist. \"Last week, we mentioned that we were showing progress on meeting the state's benchmarks for getting off the watchlist, and we are grateful for everyone's sacrifices that have resulted in slowing the spread,\" the county's public health director Barbara Ferrer said in a statement. \"Because of the lessons we learned from our explosion of cases in July, I need to ask that we continue to significantly modify our actions if we want to keep community transmission rates low,\" Ferrer said. California has the most COVID-19 cases of any state with 673,095 infections, according to the state's department of public health. Montana suspends inmate transfers due to COVID-19 outbreaks Montana officials said Tuesday they have suspended the transfer of state inmates out of three county jails because of COVID-19 outbreaks that have infected more than 90 inmates and staff. At least 34 inmates at the Yellowstone County Detention Center in Billings and 53 inmates at two staff at the Cascade County Detention Center in Great Falls have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent days. The movement suspensions will remain until the jails see a “significant reduction in active virus cases,” said State Department of Corrections spokeswoman Carolynn Bright.

Sustained tropical-storm-force winds and heavy rains had come ashore in central Louisiana as of 6 p.m. CDT, the hurricane center said. Laura, which grew to a Category 4 storm Wednesday afternoon with 140 mph winds, is forecast to bring a \"catastrophic\" storm surge, \"extrewinds and flash flooding to eastern Texas and Louisiana, according to the hurricane center. Water levels are forecast to rise quickly Wednesday evening and overnight due to storm surge and the tide, the hurricane center said. The National Weather Service has urged people who have been ordered to evacuate to take shelter in sturdy structures in a room away from windows. Hurricane Laura could bring 20-foot storm surge: Where is it, where will it be the worst? \"Dangerous winds will last for hours in many locations tonight and/or tomorrow,\" NWS tweeted. Laura is the strongest August hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico since infamous Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach said.  More than half a million people were ordered to evacuate as the storm approached, including the Texas cities of Beaumont, Galveston and Port Arthur. In Houston, more than 60% of flights entering and lea \"Hurricane Laura is a very dangerous and rapidly intensifying hurricane,\" President Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday afternoon. \"My Administration remains fully engaged with state & local emergency managers to continue preparing and assisting the great people (of) Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas.\"  Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said Wednesday, \"This is a tough storm – big, powerful, and every forecast seems to increase the intensity.\"  Edwards has activated the entire Lousiana National Guard for Laura. Several refineries along the Gulf Coast have also shut down before the hurricane makes landfall. The storm intensified a \"remarkable\" amount in the past 24 hours, the hurricane center said. And Laura is growing: \"Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles,\" forecasters said. “It looks like it’s in full beast mode,” said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. “Which is not what you want to see if you’re in its way.” 'Rapid intensification':Why Laura could be so dangerous It's the first major hurricane of the 2020 season.  One major Louisiana highway had standing water as Laura’s outer bands moved ashore with tropical-storm-force winds.  “We are expecting widespread power outages, trees down. Homes and businesses will be damaged,” said Donald Jones, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles. “I’m telling you, this is going to be a very serious situation,” Jones said. More:Fifteen years and $15 billion since Katrina, New Orleans is more prepared for a major hurricane – for now The hurricane center said parts of the Louisiana coast from Johnson Bayou to the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge could see waters rise as much as 20 feet from \"the combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide.\" Storm surge could reach as far as 30 miles inland from the coastline, the hurricane center said. \"Actions to protect life and property should be rushed to completion as water levels will begin to rise later today.\" Edwards said he expects Interstate 10 in Lake Charles and beyond to go under water, hampering search-and-rescue efforts. \"It will be inundated,\" he said Wednesday. Sabine Pass, Texas, a low-lying coastal town on the Texas-Louisiana line, was mostly boarded up and deserted Tuesday after residents got out of Laura’s path. Trucks and trailers were left behind, parked on grassy berms to try to avoid the expected 10- to 15-feet storm surge. First Rita, then Ike:Now the 'resilient' residents of this Texas town brace for Hurricane Laura. Sabine Pass has been smashed repeatedly in recent years, first by Rita in 2005, then Ike in 2008. The town has built back and boasts a top-notch school district, good fishing offshore and the quiet friendliness of a small town. The frequency of strong storms continually raises  questions about its future.  Allison Getz, spokeswoman for Jefferson County, which includes Sabine Pass, said emergency officials are worried about residents staying behind in the lower stretches of the county. The county estimates at least half of its 250,000 residents have left. Sabine Pass, in particular, could be hit hard, she said. “The concern is that they’ll be wiped out again as they have been in the past,” Getz said. “But they’re a resilient group and they’ve always been back.” Charlie Parfait, 61, has ridden out a number of storms in this region. This time, he wasn’t taking any chances. He loaded an ice machine and other equipment from his wife’s eatery, Tammie’s Diner, onto his pickup and headed to higher ground.  Rita swept away the original eatery, known as the Olde Time Diner, and they replaced it with a trailer that could be driven away when storms approach. He didn’t expect much would be left after Laura.  “When Laura hits, it’s going to be catastrophic,” Parfait said.  Flying? Change your Gulf Coast flight without a fee The hurricane threatens a center of the U.S. energy industry. The government said 84% of Gulf oil production and 61% of natural gas production were shut down. Nearly 300 platforms have been evacuated. After Laura makes landfall, the storm is expected to weaken rapidly as it makes its way north, then turns northeast. The most recent major hurricane to make landfall in Texas was Harvey in 2017, which had 130-mph maximum winds, Klotzbach said. In Louisiana, it was Rita in 2005, with 115-mph maximum winds. The Atlantic hurricane season has been a record-breaker. Laura is the earliest L-named storm in the Atlantic Basin, breaking a record held by Luis, which formed Aug. 29, 1995. This season has had 13 named storms, which is well above-normal activity.  Rick Jervis reported from Sabine Pass, Texas. Contributing: Jessica Flores, USA TODAY; Greg Hilburn, The Monroe (La.)

But when she was taken to a Detroit funeral home, staff found that she was still very much alive. Southfield Fire Chief Johnny Menifee struggled to explain Wednesday how paramedics mistakenly determined the death of Timesha Beauchamp. He suggested it could have been a case of Lazarus syndrome. The rare — but hard to scientifically explain — phenomenon has been described in research papers as a delayed return of spontaneous circulation after CPR. The name alludes to the Biblical story of Lazarus, who was resurrected by Christ after his death. \"This is a terrible, tragic thing,\" Menifee said of Sunday's incident that has been making international headlines. \"We feel terrible about this. Like I said, the entire city feels terrible about this. Personally, we're very upset about it.\" Previously:Michigan funeral home discovers woman declared dead is actually alive Southfield officials have been on the hot seat since Tuesday, when Beauchamp's lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, held a news conference and suggested that the mistake was a result of negligence. Fieger is well known for taking cases with settlements and judgments of at least $1 million. Beauchamp was diagnosed with cerebral palsy as an infant. When asked why paramedics didn't rush Beauchamp directly to the hospital, Menifee said that's \"under investigation.\" And when asked if that's what paramedics should have done, Menifee said \"no,\" adding that they followed the medical procedures. \"While ultimately, what transpired here with Ms. Beauchamp is unique and unsettling, we know that there is evidence out there that something like this has happened before,\" Menifee told news crews at City Hall. \"We're still investigating to determine what happened on that Sunday.\" Over and over again, the chief responded to reporters trying to get answers by saying the situation was under investigation, eventually ending his own news conference by walking out of the room as a reporter shouted a question at him. Menifee confirmed the two paramedics and two EMTs at the scene — all of whom are now on paid leave — checked Beauchamp three times within an hour and, each time, determined she had no life signs. The chief also noted at least two of the firefighters had experience, as 18-year and seven-year veterans.  He acknowledged and apologized for not contacting the family directly, saying that he felt \"terribly bad personally and professionally\" that he didn't. But, he felt they \"wanted and deserved answers\" and did not have them to offer.  But, the chief said he absolutely did not share concerns raised by Fieger, that negligence or discrimination may have led to a misdiagnosis, and blasted Fieger for making what he called \"grossly inaccurate statements.\" Menifee said Fieger's claim that paramedics or police placed the young woman in a body bag was completely inaccurate. Firefighters, he said, do not even carry body bags, and the paramedics left the body in care of the family. \"The men and women of this fire department are very professional,\" the chief said. \"They go out every day and deliver the best service possible to the citizens of this city. I've never had an issue with any freighter and diversity issues with a patient.\" Menifee also took issue with Fieger's insinuation that paramedics might not have contacted a physician or Michigan's Oakland County Medical Examiner. They did, the chief said, adding it was in line with proper procedure. For the most part, Menifee's and Fieger's timelines matched up. At 7:27 a.m. local time, Menifee said, the fire department responded to a 911 call the a woman was not breathing. Paramedics, he said, offered help. They arrived at 7:34 a.m. and a minute later started performing life-saving procedures for about 30 minutes to try to save her, checking her vital signs three times.  Southfield police, Menifee said, also arrived at 8:07 a.m., two minutes later, the fire department reported their findings to a physician, who determined Beauchamp had died based on the information paramedics relayed. But then, Menifee said, between 8:09 a.m. and 8:38 a.m., a family member told fire officials Beauchamp appeared to be breathing and reassessed her. They ended up with the same result and conclusion: No life signs. When paramedics went to their vehicle, Menifee said, a family member told a police officer Beauchamp had a heartbeat. They evaluated Beauchamp a third time, and, the chief said, they still detected no life signs. At about 11:30 a.m., the James H. Cole Funeral Home picked up the body. But by Fieger's account, when the Detroit funeral home checked on Beauchamp her eyes were open — and she was breathing. From the funeral home, she was taken to a nearby hospital , where she has been on a respirator.  Follow Frank Witsil on Twitter @fwitsil.
